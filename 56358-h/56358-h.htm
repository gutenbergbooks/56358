<p>For the early chapters of this book I have
consulted, amongst other authorities, the books
mentioned in the bibliography on pp. 251-254.
It would, however, be ungracious if I
failed to acknowledge my indebtedness to
that most readable of historians, Mr. Gribble,
and to his books, <i>The Early Mountaineers</i>
(Fisher Unwin) and <i>The Story of Alpine
Climbing</i> (Nelson). Mr. Gribble and his publisher,
Mr. Unwin, have kindly allowed me to
quote passages translated from the works of
the pioneers. Two friends, experts in the
practice and history of mountaineering, have
read the proofs and helped me with numerous
suggestions.

<span class="large">THE MEDIÆVAL ATTITUDE</span></h2>

<p>Rousseau is usually credited with the discovery
that mountains are not intrinsically
hideous. Long before his day, isolated men
had loved the mountains, but these men were
eccentrics. They founded no school; and
Rousseau was certainly the first to popularise
mountains and to transform the cult of hill
worship into a fashionable creed. None the
less, we must guard against the error of supposing
that mountain love was confined to
the few men who have left behind them
literary evidence of their good taste. Mountains
have changed very little since man
became articulate, and the retina of the
human eye has changed even less. The
beauty of outline that stirs us to-day was
implicit in the hills “that shed their burial
sheets about the march of Hannibal.” It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
seems reasonable to suppose that a few men
in every age have derived a certain pleasure,
if not from Alpine travel at least from the
distant view of the snows.</p>

<p>The literature of the Ancient World contains
little that bears upon our subject. The
literature of the Jews is exceptional in this
respect. This is the more to their credit, as
the mountains of Judæa, south of the beautiful
Lebanon range, are shapeless and uninteresting.
Deuteronomy, the Psalms, Job, and
Isaiah contain mountain passages of great
beauty. The Old Testament is, however, far
richer in mountain praise than the New
Testament. Christ retired more than once
to the mountains; but the authors of the
four Gospels content themselves with recording
the bare fact that certain spiritual
crises took place on mountain-tops. There is
not a single indication in all the gospels that
Nazareth is set on a hill overlooking one of
the fairest mountain prospects in all Judæa,
not a single tribute to the beauty of Galilee
girdled by the outlying hills of Hermon.</p>

<p>The Greeks lived in a land of mountains
far lovelier than Palestine’s characterless
heights. But the Jews showed genuine if
spasmodic appreciation for their native
ranges, whereas the Greeks, if their literature
does them justice, cared little or nothing for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
their mountains. The note of fear and
dread, pleasantly rare in Jewish literature, is
never long absent from Greek references to
the mountains. Of course, the Greeks gave
Olympus to their gods, but as Mr. Norman
Young remarks in a very able essay on <i>The
Mountains in Greek Poetry</i>, it was necessary
that the gods should look down on mankind;
and, as they could not be strung up
in mid-air, the obvious thing was to put them
on a mountain-top. Perhaps we may concede
that the Greeks paid a delicate compliment
to Parnassus, the Home of the Muses;
and certainly they chose for their temples
the high ground of their cities. As one
wanders through the olives and asphodels,
one feels that the Greeks chose for their
dwellings and temples those rising grounds
which afforded the noblest prospect of the
neighbouring hills. Only the cynic would
contend that they did this in order to escape
the atmosphere of the marshes.</p>

<p>The Romans were disgustingly practical.
They regarded the Alps as an inconvenient
barrier to conquest and commerce. Virgil
shows an occasional trace of a deeper feeling,
and Horace paused between draughts of
Falernian wine to admire the snows on
Soracte, which lent contrast to the comfort
of a well-ordered life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>Mr. Freshfield has shown that the Chinese
had a more genuine feeling for mountains;
and Mr. Weston has explained the ancient
cult of high places among the Japanese,
perhaps the most consistent mountain worshippers
in the world. The Japanese pilgrims,
clad in white, make the ascent to the shrines
which are built on the summits of their sacred
mountains, and then withdraw to a secluded
spot for further worship. For centuries, they
have paid official tribute to the inspiration of
high places.</p>

<p>But what of the Alps? Did the men who
lived within sight of the Swiss mountains
regard them with indifference and contempt?
This was, perhaps, the general attitude, but
there is some evidence that a love for mountains
was not quite so uncommon in the
Middle Ages as is usually supposed.</p>

<p>Before attempting to summarise this evidence,
let us try to realise the Alps as they
presented themselves to the first explorers.
The difficulties of Alpine exploration, as that
term is now understood, would have proved
quite as formidable as those which now confront
the Himalayan explorer. In spite of
this, glacier passes were crossed in the earliest
times, and even the Romans seemed to have
ventured across the Théodule, judging by
the coins which have been found on the top
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
of that great glacier highway. In addition
to the physical difficulties of Alpine travel,
we must recognise the mental handicap of
our ancestors. Danger no longer haunts the
highways and road-passes of the Alps. Wild
beasts and robber bands no longer threaten
the visitor to Grindelwald. Of the numerous
“inconveniences of travel” cited by an early
visitor to the Alps, we need now only fear
“the wonderful cunning of Innkeepers.”
Stilled are the voices that were once supposed
to speak in the thunder and the avalanche.
The dragons that used to wing their way
across the ravines of the central chain have
joined the Dodo and “the men that eat the
flesh of serpents and hiss as serpents do.”
Danger, a luxury to the modern, formed part
of the routine of mediæval life. Our ancestors
had no need to play at peril; and, lest we
lightly assume that the modern mountaineer
is a braver man than those who shuddered
on the St. Bernard, let us remember that our
ancestors accepted with grave composure a
daily portion of inevitable risks. Modern life
is so secure that we are forced to the Alps
in search of contrast. When our ancestors
needed contrast, they joined a monastery.</p>

<p>Must we assume that danger blinded them
to the beauty of the Alps? The mountains
themselves have not changed. The modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
mountaineer sees, from the windows of the
Berne express, a picture whose colours have
not faded in the march of Time. The bar of
silver that thrusts itself above the distant
foothills, as the train swings out of the
wooded fortress of the Jura, casts the same
challenge across the long shadows of the uplands.
The peaks are a little older, but the
vision that lights the world for us shone with
the same steadfast radiance across the plains
of long ago. Must we believe that our
adventurous forefathers could find nothing
but fear in the snows of the great divide?
Dangers which have not yet vanished menaced
their journey, but the white gleam of the
distant snows was no less beautiful in the
days when it shone as a beacon light to
guide the adventurous through the great
barrier down the warmth of Italian lowlands.
An age which could face the great adventure
of the Crusades for an idea, or more often for
the sheer lust of romantic wandering, was not
an age easily daunted by peril and discomfort.
May we not hope that many a mute, inglorious
mountain-lover lifted his eyes across
the fields and rivers near Basle or Constance,
and found some hint of elusive beauty in the
vision that still remains a mystery, even for
those who have explored the once trackless
snows?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>Those who have tried to discover the
mediæval attitude have too often merely
generalised from detached expressions of
horror. Passages of praise have been treated
as exceptional. The Monk Bremble and the
Bishop Berkeley have had their say, unchallenged
by equally good evidence for the
defence. Let us remember that plenty of
modern travellers might show an equally
pronounced distaste for mountains. For the
defence, we might quote the words of an old
traveller borrowed in Coryat’s <i>Crudities</i>, a
book which appeared in 1611: “What, I
pray you, is more pleasant, more delectable,
and more acceptable unto a man than to
behold the height of hilles, as it were the very
Atlantes of heauen? to admire Hercules his
pillers? to see the mountaines Taurus and
Caucasus? to view the hill Olympus, the seat
of Jupiter? to pass over the Alpes that were
broken by Annibals Vinegar? to climb up
the Apennine promontory of Italy? from
the hill Ida to behold the rising of the
Sunne before the Sunne appears? to visit
Parnassus and Helicon, the most celebrated
seates of the Muses? Neither indeed is there
any hill or hillocke, which doth not containe
in it the most sweete memory of worthy
matters.”</p>

<p>There is the genuine ring about this. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
the modern spirit without the modern affectations.
Nor is this case exceptional. In the
following chapter we shall sketch the story
of the early Alpine explorers, and we shall
quote many passages instinct with the real
love for the hills.</p>

<p>Are we not entitled to believe that Gesner,
Marti, and Petrarch are characteristic of
one phase of mediæval sentiment, just as
Bremble is characteristic of another? There
is abundant evidence to show that the habit
of visiting and admiring mountain scenery
had become fashionable before the close of
the sixteenth century. Simler tells us that
foreigners came from all lands to marvel at
the mountains, and excuses a certain lack of
interest among his compatriots on the ground
that they are surfeited with a too close knowledge
of the Alps. Marti, of whom we shall
speak at greater length, tells us that he found
on the summit of the Stockhorn the Greek
inscription cut in a stone which may be
rendered: “The love of mountains is best.”
And then there is the evidence of art. Conventional
criticism of mountain art often
revolves in a circle: “The mediæval man
detested mountains, and when he painted a
mountain he did so by way of contrast to set
off the beauty of the plains.” Or again:
“Mediæval man only painted mountains as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
types of all that is terrible in Nature. Therefore,
mediæval man detested mountains.”</p>

<p>Let us try to approach the work of these
early craftsmen with no preconceived notions
as to their sentiments. The canvases still
remain as they were painted. What do they
teach us? It is not difficult to discriminate
between those who used mountains to point
a contrast, and those who lingered with
devotion on the beauty of the hills. When we
find a man painting mountains loosely and
carelessly, we may assume that he was not
over fond of his subject. Jan von Scorel’s
grotesque rocks show nothing but equally
grotesque fear. Hans Altdorfer’s elaborate
and careful work proves that he was at least
interested in mountains, and had cleared his
mind of conventional terror. Roughly, we
may say that, where the foreground shows
good and the mountain background shows
bad workmanship, the artist cared nothing for
hills, and only threw them in by way of
gloomy contrast. But such pictures are not
the general rule.</p>

<p>Let us take a very early mountain painting
that dates from 1444. It is something of a
shock to find the Salève and Mont Blanc as
the background to a New Testament scene.
How is the background used? Konrad Witz,
the painter, has chosen for his theme the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
miraculous draught of fishes. If he had
borrowed a mountain background for the
Temptation, the Betrayal, the Agony, or the
Crucifixion, we might contend that the mountains
were introduced to accentuate the
gloom. But there is no suggestion of fear
or sorrow in the peaceful calm that followed
the storm of Calvary. The mountains in
the distance are the hills as we know them.
There is no reason to think that they are
intended as a contrast to the restful foreground.
Rather, they seem to complete and
round off the happy serenity of the picture.</p>

<p>Let us consider the mountain work of a
greater man than Witz. We may be thankful
that Providence created this barrier of hills
between the deep earnestness of the North
and the tolerance of Italy, for to this we
owe some of the best mountain-scapes of
the Middle Ages. There is romance in the
thought of Albrecht Dürer crossing the
Brenner on his way to the Venetian lagoons
that he loved so well. Did Dürer regard
this journey with loathing? Were the great
Alps no more than an obstacle on the road
to the coast where the Adriatic breaks “in
a warm bay ’mid green Illyrian hills.” Did
he echo the pious cry of that old Monk who
could only pray to be delivered from “this
place of torment,” or did he rather linger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
with loving memory on the wealth of inspiring
suggestion gathered in those adventurous
journeys? Contrast is the essence
of Art, and Dürer was too great a man to
miss the rugged appeal of untamed cliffs,
because he could fathom so easily the gentler
charm of German fields and Italian waters.
You will find in these mountain woodcuts the
whole essence of the lovable German romance,
that peculiar note of “snugness” due to the
contrast of frowning rock and some “gemütlich”
Black Forest châlet. Hans Andersen,
though a Dane, caught this note; and in
Dürer’s work there is the same appealing
romance that makes the “Ice Maiden” the
most lovable of Alpine stories. One can
almost see Rudy marching gallantly up the
long road in Dürer’s “Das Grosse Glück,” or
returning with the eaglets stolen from their
perilous nest in the cliffs that shadow the
“Heimsuch.” Those who pretend that Dürer
introduced mountains as a background of
gloom have no sense for atmosphere nor for
anything else. For Dürer, the mountains
were the home of old romance.</p>

<p>Turn from Dürer to Da Vinci, and you will
find another note. Da Vinci was, as we shall
see, a climber, and this gives the dominant
note to his great study of storm and thunder
among the peaks, to be seen at Windsor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
Castle. His mountain rambles have given
him that feeling of worship, tempered by awe,
which even the Climbers’ Guides have not
banished. But this book is not a treatise on
mountain Art&mdash;a fascinating subject; and we
must content ourselves with the statement
that painters of all ages have found in the
mountains the love which is more powerful
than fear. Those who doubt this may examine
at leisure the mountain work of Brueghel,
Titian, or Mantegna. There are many other
witnesses. At the beginning of the sixteenth
century, Hans Leu had looked upon the hills
and found them good, and Altdorfer had
shown not only a passionate enthusiasm for
mountains, but a knowledge of their anatomy
far ahead of his age. Wolf Huber, ten years
his junior, carried on the torch, and passed
it to Lautensack, who recaptured the peculiar
note of German romance of which Dürer is
the first and the greatest apostle. It would
be easy to trace the apostolic succession to
Segantini, and to prove that he is the heir
to a tradition nearly six hundred years old.
But enough has been said. We have adduced
a few instances which bear upon the contention
that, just as the mountains of the
Middle Ages were much the same as the
mountains of to-day, so also among the men
of those times, as among the men of to-day,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
there were those who hated and those who
loved the heights. No doubt the lovers of
mountain scenery were in the minority; but
they existed in far larger numbers than is
sometimes supposed.

<span class="large">THE PIONEERS</span></h2>

<p>Within the compass of this book, we
cannot narrate the history of Alpine passes,
though the subject is intensely interesting,
but we must not omit all mention of the
great classic traverse of the Alps. We should
read of Hannibal’s memorable journey not
in Livy, nor even in Bohn, but in that vigorous
sixteenth-century translation which owes its
charm and force even more to Philemon
Holland the translator than to Livy.</p>

<p>Livy, or rather Holland, begins with
Hannibal’s sentiments on “seeing near at
hand the height of those hills ... the horses
singed with cold ... the people with long
shagd haire.” Hannibal and his army were
much depressed, but, none the less, they
advanced under a fierce guerilla attack from
the natives, who “slipt away at night, every
one to his owne harbour.” Then follows a
fine description of the difficulties of the pass.
The poor elephants “were ever readie and
anone to run upon their noses”&mdash;a phrase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
which evokes a tremendous picture&mdash;“and
the snow being once with the gate of so many
people and beasts upon it fretted and thawed,
they were fain to go upon the bare yce underneeth
and in the slabberie snow-broth as it
relented and melted about their heeles.” A
great rock hindered the descent; Hannibal
set it on fire and “powred thereon strong
vinegar for to calcine and dissolve it,” a
device unknown to modern mountaineers.
The passage ends with a delightful picture
of the army’s relief on reaching “the dales
and lower grounds which have some little
banks lying to the sunne, and rivers withall
neere unto the woods, yea and places more
meet and beseeming for men to inhabit.”
Experts are divided as to what pass was
actually crossed by Hannibal. Even the Col
de Géant has been suggested by a romantic
critic; it is certainly stimulating to picture
Hannibal’s elephants in the Géant ice-fall.
Probably the Little St. Bernard, or the Mont
Genèvre, is the most plausible solution. So
much for the great traverse.</p>

<p>Some twenty-five glacier passes had been
actually crossed before the close of the
sixteenth century, a fact which bears out
our contention that in the Middle Ages a
good deal more was known about the craft
of mountaineering than is generally supposed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
There is, however, this distinctive difference
between passes and peaks. A man may
cross a pass because it is the most convenient
route from one valley to another. He may
cross it though he is thoroughly unhappy
until he reaches his destination, and it would
be just as plausible to argue from his journey
a love of mountains as to deduce a passion
for the sea in every sea-sick traveller across
the Channel. But a man will not climb a
mountain unless he derives some interest
from the actual ascent. Passes may be
crossed in the way of business. Mountains
will only be climbed for the joy of the climb.</p>

<p>The Roche Melon, near Susa, was the first
Alpine peak of any consequence to be climbed.
This mountain rises to a height of 11,600 feet.
It was long believed to be the highest mountain
in Savoy. On one side there is a small
glacier; but the climb can be effected without
crossing snow. It was climbed during the
Dark Ages by a knight, Rotario of Asti, who
deposited a bronze tryptych on the summit
where a chapel still remains. Once a year
the tryptych is carried to the summit, and
Mass is heard in the chapel. There is a
description of an attempt on this peak in the
Chronicle of Novalessa, which dates back to
the first half of the eleventh century. King
Romulus is said to have deposited treasure on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the mountain. The whole Alpine history of
this peak is vague, but it is certain that the
peak was climbed at a very early period, and
that a chapel was erected on the summit before
Villamont’s ascent in 1588. The climb
presents no difficulties, but it was found discreet
to remove the statue of the Virgin, as
pilgrims seem to have lost their lives in
attempting to reach it. The pilgrimages did
not cease even after the statue had been
placed in Susa.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="small author">Bartholomew, Edin</p>
</div>

<p>Another early ascent must be recorded,
though the climb was a very modest achievement.
Mont Ventoux, in Provence, is only
some 6430 feet above the sea, and to-day
there is an hôtel on the summit. None the
less, it deserves a niche in Alpine history, for
its ascent is coupled with the great name of
the poet Petrarch. Mr. Gribble calls Petrarch
the first of the sentimental mountaineers.
Certainly, he was one of the first mountaineers
whose recorded sentiments are very much
ahead of his age. The ascent took place on
April 26, 1335, and Petrarch described it
in a letter written to his confessor. He
confesses that he cherished for years the
ambition to ascend Mont Ventoux, and
seized the first chance of a companion to
carry through this undertaking. He makes
the customary statement as to the extreme
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
difficulty of the ascent, and introduces a
shepherd who warns him from the undertaking.
There are some very human touches
in the story of the climb. While his brother
was seeking short cuts, Petrarch tried to
advance on more level ground, an excuse for
his laziness which cost him dear, for the
others had made considerable progress while
he was still wandering in the gullies of the
mountain. He began to find, like many
modern mountaineers, that “human ingenuity
was not a match for the nature of
things, and that it was impossible to gain
heights by moving downwards.” He successfully
completed the ascent, and the climb
filled him with enthusiasm. The reader
should study the fine translation of his letter
by Mr. Reeve, quoted in <i>The Early Mountaineers</i>.
Petrarch caught the romance of
heights. The spirit that breathes through
every line of his letter is worthy of the poet.</p>

<p>Petrarch is not the only great name that
links the Renaissance to the birth of mountaineering.
That versatile genius, Leonardo
da Vinci, carried his scientific explorations
into the mountains. We have already mentioned
his great picture of storm and thunder
among the hills, one of the few mementos
that have survived from his Alpine journeys.
His journey took place towards the end of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the fifteenth century. Little is known of
it, though the following passage from his
works has provoked much comment. The
translation is due to Mrs. Bell: “And this
may be seen, as I saw it, by any one going up
Monboso, a peak of the Alps which divide
France from Italy. The base of this mountain
gives birth to the four rivers which flow
in four different directions through the whole
of Europe. And no mountain has its base
at so great a height as this, which lifts itself
above almost all the clouds; and snow
seldom falls there, but only hail in the summer
when the clouds are highest. And this hail
lies (unmelted) there, so that, if it were not
for the absorption of the rising and falling
clouds, which does not happen more than
twice in an age, an enormous mass of ice
would be piled up there by the layers of hail;
and in the middle of July I found it very
considerable, and I saw the sky above me
quite dark; and the sun as it fell on the
mountain was far brighter here than in the
plains below, because a smaller extent of
atmosphere lay between the summit of the
mountain and the sun.”</p>

<p>We need not summarise the arguments
that identify Monboso either with Monte
Rosa or Monte Viso. The weight of evidence
inclines to the former alternative, though, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
course, nobody supposes that Da Vinci
actually reached the summit of Monte Rosa.
There is good ground, however, for believing
that he explored the lower slopes; and it is
just possible that he may have got as far as
the rocks above the Col d’Ollen, where, according
to Mr. Freshfield, the inscription “A.T.M.,
1615” has been found cut into the crags at
a height of 10,000 feet. In this connection
it is interesting to note that the name “Monboso”
has been found in place of Monte Rosa
in maps, as late as 1740.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>We now come to the first undisputed ascent
of a mountain, still considered a difficult
rock climb. The year that saw the discovery
of America is a great date in the history
of mountaineering. In 1492, Charles VII of
France passed through Dauphiny, and was
much impressed by the appearance of Mont
Aiguille, a rocky peak near Grenoble that
was then called Mont Inaccessible. This
mountain is only some seven thousand feet
in height; but it is a genuine rock climb, and
is still considered difficult, so much so that
the French Alpine Club have paid it the
doubtful compliment of iron cables in the
more sensational passages. Charles VII was
struck by the appearance of the mountain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
and ordered his Chamberlain de Beaupré to
make the ascent. Beaupré, by the aid of
“subtle means and engines,” scaled the peak,
had Mass said on the top, and caused three
crosses to be erected on the summit. It was
a remarkable ascent, and was not repeated
till 1834.</p>

<p>We are not concerned with exploration
beyond the Alps, and we have therefore
omitted Peter III’s attempt on Pic Canigou
in the Pyrenees, and the attempt on the
Pic du Midi in 1588; but we cannot on the
ground of irrelevance pass over a remarkable
ascent in 1521. Cortez is our authority.
Under his order, a band of Spaniards ascended
Popocatapetl, a Mexican volcano which
reaches the respectable height of 17,850 feet.
These daring climbers brought back quantities
of sulphur which the army needed for its
gunpowder.</p>

<p>The Stockhorn is a modest peak some
seven thousand feet in height. Simler tells us
that its ascent was a commonplace achievement.
Marti, as we have seen in the previous
chapter, found numberless inscriptions cut
into the summit stones by visitors, enthusiastic
in their appreciation of mountain
scenery, and its ascent by Müller, a Berne
professor, in 1536, is only remarkable for the
joyous poem in hexameters which records his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
delight in all the accompaniments of a mountain
expedition. Müller has the true feelings
for the simpler pleasures of picnicing on the
heights. Everything delights him, from the
humble fare washed down with a draught
from a mountain stream, to the primitive joy
of hurling big rocks down a mountain side.
The last confession endears him to all who
have practised this simple, if dangerous,
amusement.</p>

<p>The early history of Pilatus, another low-lying
mountain, is much more eventful than
the annals of the Stockhorn. It is closely
bound up with the Pilate legend, which was
firmly believed till a Lucerne pastor gave it
the final quietus in 1585. Pontius Pilate,
according to this story, was condemned by
the Emperor Tiberius, who decreed that he
should be put to death in the most shameful
possible manner. Hearing this, Pilate very
sensibly committed suicide. Tiberius concealed
his chagrin, and philosophically remarked
that a man whose own hand had not
spared him had most certainly died the most
shameful of deaths. Pilate’s body was attached
to a stone and flung into the Tiber,
where it caused a succession of terrible
storms. The Romans decided to remove it,
and the body was conveyed to Vienne as a
mark of contempt for the people of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
place. It was flung into the Rhone, and did
its best to maintain its reputation. We need
not follow this troublesome corpse through
its subsequent wanderings. It was finally
hurled into a little marshy lake, near the
summit of Pilatus. Here Pilate’s behaviour
was tolerable enough, though he resented
indiscriminate stone-throwing into the lake
by evoking terrible storms, and once a year
he escaped from the waters, and sat clothed
in a scarlet robe on a rock near by. Anybody
luckless enough to see him on these occasions
died within the twelve-month.</p>

<p>So much for the story, which was firmly
believed by the good citizens of Lucerne.
Access to the lake was forbidden, unless the
visitor was accompanied by a respectable
burgher, pledged to veto any practices that
Pilate might construe as a slight. In 1307,
six clergymen were imprisoned for having
attempted an ascent without observing the
local regulations. It is even said that climbers
were occasionally put to death for breaking
these stringent by-laws. None the less,
ascents occasionally took place. Duke Ulrich
of Württemberg climbed the mountain in 1518,
and a professor of Vienna, by name Joachim
von Watt, ascended the mountain in order
to investigate the legend, which he seems to
have believed after a show of doubt. Finally,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
in 1585, Pastor John Müller of Lucerne,
accompanied by a few courageous sceptics,
visited the lake. In their presence, he threw
stones into the haunted lake, and shouted
“Pilate wirf aus dein Kath.” As his taunts
produced no effect, judgment was given by
default, and the legend, which had sent
earlier sceptics into gaol, was laughed out of
existence.</p>

<p>Thirty years before this defiant demonstration,
the mountain had been ascended by the
most remarkable of the early mountaineers.
Conrad Gesner was a professor at the ancient
University of Zürich. Though not the first
to make climbing a regular practice, he was
the pioneer of mountain literature. He never
encountered serious difficulties. His mountaineering
was confined to those lower heights
which provide the modern with a training
walk. But he had the authentic outlook of
the mountaineer. His love for mountains was
more genuine than that of many a modern
wielder of the ice-axe and rope. A letter
has been preserved, in which he records his
resolution “to climb mountains, or at all
events to climb one mountain every year.”</p>

<p>We have no detailed record of his climbs,
but luckily his account of an ascent of Pilatus
still survives, a most sincere tribute to the
simple pleasures of the heights. It is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
relief to turn to it after wading through more
recent Alpine literature. Gesner’s writing is
subjective. It records the impress of simple
emotions on an unsophisticated mind. He
finds a naïve joy in all the elemental things
that make up a mountain walk, the cool
breezes plying on heated limbs, the sun’s
genial warmth, the contrasts of outline, colour,
and height, the unending variety, so that
“in one day you wander through the four
seasons of the year, Spring, Summer, Autumn
and Winter.” He explains that every sense
is delighted, the sense of hearing is gratified
by the witty conversation of friends, “by the
songs of the birds, and even by the stillness
of the waste.” He adds, in a very modern
note, that the mountaineer is freed from the
noisy tumult of the city, and that in the
“profound abiding silence one catches echoes
of the harmony of celestial spheres.” There
is more in the same key. He anticipates the
most enduring reward of the mountaineer,
and his words might serve as the motto for
a mountain book of to-day: “Jucundum erit
postea meminisse laborum atque periculorum,
juvabit hæc animo revolvere et narrare
amicis.” Toil and danger are sweet to recall,
every mountaineer loves “to revolve these
in his mind and to tell them to his friends.”
Moreover, contrast is the essence of our enjoyment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
and “the very delight of rest is intensified
when it follows hard labour.” And
then Gesner turns with a burst of scorn to his
imaginary opponent. “But, say you, we
lack feather beds and mattresses and pillows.
Oh, frail and effeminate man! Hay shall
take the place of these luxuries. It is soft,
it is fragrant. It is blended from healthy
grass and flower, and as you sleep respiration
will be sweeter and healthier than ever. Your
pillow shall be of hay. Your mattress shall
be of hay. A blanket of hay shall be thrown
across your body.” That is the kind of thing
an enthusiastic mountaineer might have
written about the club-huts in the old days
before the hay gave place to mattresses. Nor
does Gesner spoil his rhapsody by the inevitable
joke about certain denizens of the
hay.</p>

<p>There follows an eloquent description of
the ascent and an analysis of the Pilate
legend. Thirty years were to pass before
Pastor Müller finally disposed of the myth,
but Gesner is clearly sceptical, and concludes
with the robust assertion that, even if evil
spirits exist, they are “impotent to harm the
faithful who worship the one heavenly light,
and Christ the Sun of Justice.” A bold
challenge to the superstitions of the age, a
challenge worthy of the man. Conrad Gesner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
was born out of due season; and, though he
does not seem to have crossed the snow line,
he was a mountaineer in the best sense of the
term. As we read his work, we seem to hear
the voice of a friend. Across the years we
catch the accents of a true member of our
great fraternity. We leave him with regret,
with a wish that we could meet him on some
mountain path, and gossip for a while on
mountains and mountaineers.</p>

<p>But Gesner was not, as is sometimes
assumed, alone in this sentiment for the hills.
In the first chapter we have spoken of Marti,
a professor at Berne, and a close friend of
Gesner. The credit for discovering him belongs,
I think, to Mr. Freshfield, who quotes
some fine passages from Marti’s writings.
Marti looks out from the terrace at Berne on
that prospect which no true mountain lover
can behold without emotion, and exclaims:
“These are the mountains which form our
pleasure and delight when we gaze at them
from the highest parts of our city, and admire
their mighty peaks and broken crags that
threaten to fall at any moment. Who, then,
would not admire, love, willingly visit, explore,
and climb places of this sort? I should
assuredly call those who are not attracted by
them dolts, stupid dull fishes, and slow
tortoises.... I am never happier than on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the mountain crests, and there are no wanderings
dearer to one than those on the
mountains.”</p>

<p>This passage tends to prove that mountain
appreciation had already become a commonplace
with cultured men. Had Marti’s views
been exceptional, he would have assumed a
certain air of defence. He would explain
precisely why he found pleasure in such unexpected
places. He would attempt to justify
his paradoxical position. Instead, he boldly
assumes that every right-minded man loves
mountains; and he confounds his opponents
by a vigorous choice of unpleasant alternatives.</p>

<p>Josias Simler was a mountaineer of a very
different type. To him belongs the credit of
compiling the first treatise on the art of
Alpine travel. Though he introduces no
personal reminiscences, his work is so free
from current superstition that he must have
been something of a climber; but, though a
climber, he did not share Gesner’s enthusiasm
for the hills. For, though he seems to have
crossed glacier passes, whereas Gesner confined
himself to the lower mountains, yet the note
of enthusiasm is lacking. His horror of
narrow paths, bordering on precipices, is
typical of the age; and if he ventured across
a pass he must have done so in the way of
business. There is, as we have already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
pointed out, a marked difference between
passes and mountains. A merchant with a
holy horror of mountains may be forced to
cross a pass in the way of business, but a man
will only climb a mountain for the fun of the
thing. It is clear that Simler could only see
in mountains a sense of inconvenient barriers
to commerce, but as a practical man he set
out to codify the existing knowledge. Gesner’s
mountain work is subjective; it is the literature
of emotion; he is less concerned with the
mountain in itself, than with the mountain
as it strikes the individual observer. Simler,
on the other hand, is the forerunner of the
objective school. He must delight those
who postulate that all Alpine literature should
be the record of positive facts. The personal
note is utterly lacking. Like Gesner, he was
a professor at Zürich. Unlike Gesner, he was
an embodiment of the academic tradition
that is more concerned with fact than with
emotion. None the less, his work was a very
valuable contribution, as it summarised existing
knowledge on the art of mountain travel.
His information is singularly free from error.
He seems to have understood the use of the
rope, alpenstocks, crampons, dark spectacles,
and the use of paper as a protection against
cold. It is strange that crampons, which
were used in Simler’s days, were only reintroduced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
into general practice within the last
decades, whilst the uncanny warmth of paper
is still unknown to many mountaineers. His
description of glacier perils, due to concealed
crevasses, is accurate, and his analysis of
avalanches contains much that is true. We
are left with the conviction that snow- and
ice-craft is an old science, though originally
applied by merchants rather than pure
explorers.</p>

<p>We quoted Simler, in the first chapter, in
support of our contention that foreigners
came in great numbers to see and rejoice in
the beauty of the Alps. But, though Simler
proves that passes were often crossed in the
way of business, and that mountains were
often visited in search of beauty, he himself
was no mountain lover.</p>

<p>It is a relief to turn to Scheuchzer, who is a
living personality. Like Gesner and Simler,
he was a professor at Zürich, and, like them,
he was interested in mountains. There the
resemblance ceases. He had none of Gesner’s
fine sentiment for the hills. He did not share
Simler’s passion for scientific knowledge. He
was a very poor mountaineer, and, though he
trudged up a few hills, he heartily disliked
the toil of the ascent: “Anhelosæ quidem
sunt scansiones montium”&mdash;an honest, but
scarcely inspiring, comment on mountain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
travel. Honesty, bordering on the naïve, is,
indeed, the keynote of our good professor’s
confessions. Since his time, many ascents
have failed for the same causes that prevented
Scheuchzer reaching the summit of
Pilatus, but few mountaineers are candid
enough to attribute their failure to “bodily
weariness and the distance still to be accomplished.”
Scheuchzer must be given credit
for being, in many ways, ahead of his age.
He protested vigorously against the cruel
punishments in force against witches. He
was the first to formulate a theory of glacier
motion which, though erroneous, was by no
means absurd. As a scientist, he did good
work in popularising Newton’s theories. He
published the first map of Switzerland with
any claims to accuracy. His greatest scientific
work on dragons is dedicated to the English
Royal Society, and though Scheuchzer’s
dragons provoke a smile, we should remember
that several members of that learned society
subscribed to publish his researches on those
fabulous creatures.</p>

<p>With his odd mixture of credulity and
common sense, Scheuchzer often recalls
another genial historian of vulgar errors.
Like Sir Thomas Browne, he could never
dismiss a picturesque legend without a pang.
He gives the more blatant absurdities their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
quietus with the same gentle and reluctant
touch: “That the sea is the sweat of the
earth, that the serpent before the fall went
erect like man ... being neither consonant
unto reason nor corresponding unto experiment,
are unto us no axioms.” Thus Browne,
and it is with the same tearful and chastened
scepticism that Scheuchzer parts with the more
outrageous “axioms” in his wonderful collection.
But he retained enough to make his
work amusing. Like Browne, he made it a
rule to believe half that he was told. But on
the subject of dragons he has no mental
reservations. Their existence is proved by
the number of caves that are admirably suited
to the needs of the domestic dragon, and by
the fact that the Museum, at Lucerne, contains
an undoubted dragon stone. Such
stones are rare, which is not surprising owing
to the extreme difficulty of obtaining a genuine
unimpaired specimen. You must first catch
your dragon asleep, and then cut the stone
out of his head. Should the dragon awake the
value of the stone will disappear. Scheuchzer
refrains from discouraging collectors by hinting
at even more unpleasant possibilities. But
then there is no need to awaken the dragon.
Scatter soporific herbs around him, and help
them out by recognised incantations, and the
stone should be removed without arousing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the dragon. In spite of these anæsthetics,
Scheuchzer admits that the process demands
a courageous and skilled operator, and perhaps
it is lucky that this particular stone was
casually dropped by a passing dragon. It is
obviously genuine, for, if the peasant who had
picked it up had been dishonest, he would
never have hit on so obvious and unimaginative
a tale. He would have told some really
striking story, such as that the stone had
come from the far Indies. Besides, the stone
not only cures hæmorrhages (quite commonplace
stones will cure hæmorrhages), but
also dysentery and plague. As to dragons,
Scheuchzer is even more convincing. He has
examined (on oath) scores of witnesses who
had observed dragons at first hand. We need
not linger to cross-examine these honest folk.
Their dragons are highly coloured, and lack
nothing but uniformity. Each new dragon
that flies into Scheuchzer’s net is gravely
classified. Some dragons have feet, others
have wings. Some have scales. Scheuchzer
is a little puzzled whether dragons with a
crest constitute a class of their own, or
whether the crest distinguished the male from
the female. Each dragon is thus neatly
ticketed into place and referred to the sworn
deposition of some <i>vir quidam probus</i>.</p>

<p>But the dragons had had their day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Scheuchzer ushers in the eighteenth century.
Let us take leave of him with a friendly smile.
He is no abstraction, but a very human soul.
We forget the scientist, though his more
serious discoveries were not without value.
We remember only the worthy professor,
panting up his laborious hills in search of
quaint knowledge, discovering with simple
joy that Gemmi is derived from “gemitus”
a groan, <i>quod non nisi crebris gemitibus
superetur</i>. No doubt the needy fraternity
soon discovered his amiable weakness. An
unending procession must have found their
way to his door, only too anxious to supply
him with dragons of wonderful and fearful
construction. Hence, the infinite variety
of these creatures. When we think of
Scheuchzer, we somehow picture the poor old
gentleman, laboriously rearranging his data,
on the sworn deposition of some <i>clarissimus
homo</i>, what time the latter was bartering in
the nearest tavern the price of a dragon for
that good cheer in which most of Scheuchzer’s
fauna first saw the light of day.

<span class="large">THE OPENING UP OF THE ALPS</span></h2>

<p>The climbs, so far chronicled, have been
modest achievements and do not include a
genuine snow-peak, for the Roche Melon has
permanent snow on one side only. We have
seen that many snow passes were in regular
use from the earliest times; but genuine Alpine
climbing may be said to begin with the ascent
of the Titlis. According to Mr. Gribble, this
was climbed by a monk of Engleberg, in 1739.
Mr. Coolidge, on the other hand, states that
it was ascended by four peasants, in 1744.
In any case, the ascent was an isolated feat
which gave no direct stimulus to Alpine
climbing, and Mr. Gribble is correct in dating
the continuous history of Alpine climbing
from the discovery of Chamounix, in 1741.
This famous valley had, of course, a history
of its own before that date; but its existence
was only made known, to a wider world, by
the visit of a group of young Englishmen,
towards the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In 1741, Geneva was enlivened by a vigorous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
colony of young Britons. Of these, William
Windham was a famous athlete, known on
his return to London as “Boxing Windham.”
While at Geneva, he seems, despite the presence
of his “respectable perceptor,” Mr.
Benjamin Stillingfleet, the grandson of the
theologian, to have amused himself pretty
thoroughly. The archives record that he
was fined for assault and kindred offences.
When these simple joys began to pall he
decided to go to Chamounix in search of
adventure.</p>

<p>His party consisted of himself, Lord Haddington,
Dr. Pococke, the Oriental traveller,
and others. They visited Chamounix, and
climbed the Montanvert with a large brigade
of guides. The ascent to the Montanvert
was not quite so simple as it is to-day, a fact
which accounts for Windham’s highly coloured
description. Windham published his account
of the journey and his reflections on glaciers,
in the <i>Journal Helvetique</i> of Neuchâtel, and
later in London. It attracted considerable
attention and focussed the eyes of the curious
on the unknown valley of Chamounix. Among
others, Peter Martel, an engineer of Geneva,
was inspired to repeat the visit. Like Windham,
he climbed the Montanvert and descended
on to the Mer de Glace; and, like
Windham, he published an account of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
journey and certain reflections on glaciers and
glacier motion. His story is well worth reading,
and the curious in such matters should
turn either to Mr. Gribble’s <i>Early Mountaineers</i>,
or to Mr. Matthews’ <i>The Annals of Mont
Blanc</i>, where they will find Windham’s and
Martel’s letters set forth in full.</p>

<p>Martel’s letter and his map of Chamounix
were printed together with Windham’s narrative,
and were largely responsible for popularising
Chamounix. Those who wished to earn
a reputation for enterprise could hardly do
so without a visit to the glaciers of Chamounix.
Dr. John Moore, father of Sir John Moore,
who accompanied the Duke of Hamilton on
the grand tour, tells us that “one could
hardly mention anything curious or singular
without being told by some of those travellers,
with an air of cool contempt: ‘Dear Sir, that
is pretty well, but take my word for it, it is
nothing to the glaciers of Savoy.’” The
Duc de la Rochefoucauld considered that
the honour of his nation demanded that he
should visit the glaciers, to prove that the
English were not alone in the possession of
courage.</p>

<p>More important, in this connection, than
Dr. Moore or the duke is the great name of
De Saussure. De Saussure belonged to an
old French family that had been driven out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of France during the Huguenot persecutions.
They emigrated to Geneva, where De Saussure
was born. His mother had Spartan views on
education; and from his earlier years the child
was taught to suffer the privations due to
physical ills and the inclemency of the season.
As a result of this adventurous training, De
Saussure was irresistibly drawn to the mountains.
He visited Chamounix in 1760, and
was immediately struck by the possibility
of ascending Mont Blanc. He does not seem
to have cherished any ambition to make the
first ascent in person. He was content to
follow when once the way had been found;
and he offered a reward to the pioneer, and
promised to recompense any peasant who
should lose a day’s work in trying to find the
way to the summit of Mont Blanc. The
reward was not claimed for many years, but,
meanwhile, De Saussure never missed a chance
of climbing a mountain. He climbed Ætna,
and made a series of excursions in various
parts of the Alps. When his wife complained,
he indited a robust letter which every married
mountaineer should keep up his sleeve for
ready quotation.</p>

<p>“In this valley, which I had not previously
visited,” he writes, “I have made observations
of the greatest importance, surpassing
my highest hopes; but that is not what you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
care about. You would sooner&mdash;God forgive
me for saying so&mdash;see me growing fat like a
friar, and snoring every day in the chimney
corner, after a big dinner, than that I should
achieve immortal fame by the most sublime
discoveries at the cost of reducing my weight
by a few ounces and spending a few weeks
away from you. If, then, I continue to take
these journeys, in spite of the annoyance they
cause you, the reason is that I feel myself
pledged in honour to go on with them, and
that I think it necessary to extend my knowledge
on this subject and make my works as
nearly perfect as possible. I say to myself:
‘Just as an officer goes out to assault a fortress
when the order is given, and just as a
merchant goes to market on market-day, so
must I go to the mountains when there are
observations to be made.’”</p>

<p>De Saussure was partly responsible for the
great renaissance of mountain travel that
began at Geneva in 1760. A group of enthusiastic
mountaineers instituted a series of
determined assaults on the unconquered snows.
Of these, one of the most remarkable was
Jean-Andre de Luc.</p>

<p>De Luc was born at Geneva, in 1727. His
father was a watchmaker, but De Luc’s life
was cast on more ambitious lines. He began
as a diplomatist, but gravitated insensibly to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
science. He invented the hygrometer, and
was elected a member of the Royal Societies
of London, Dublin, and Göttingen. Charlotte,
the wife of George III, appointed him her
reader; and he died at Windsor, having
attained the ripe age of ninety. He was a
scientific, rather than a sentimental, mountaineer;
his principal occupation was to
discover the temperature at which water
would boil at various altitudes. His chief
claim to notice is that he made the first
ascent of the Buet.</p>

<p>The Buet is familiar to all who know
Chamounix. It rises to the height of 10,291
feet. Its summit is a broad plateau, glacier-capped.
Those who have travelled to Italy
by the Simplon may, perhaps, recall the
broad-topped mountain that seems to block
up the western end of the Rhone valley, for
the Buet is a conspicuous feature on the line,
between Sion and Brigue. It is not a difficult
mountain, in the modern sense of the term;
but, to climbers who knew little of the nature
of snow and glacier, it must have presented
quite a formidable appearance. De Luc made
several attempts before he was finally successful
on September 22, 1770. His description
of the view from the summit is a fine piece
of writing. Familiarity had not staled the
glory of such moments; and men might still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
write, as they felt, without fear that their
readers would be bored by emotions that had
lost their novelty.</p>

<p>Before leaving, De Luc observed that the
party were standing on a cornice. A cornice
is a crest of windblown snow overhanging a
precipice. As the crest often appears perfectly
continuous with the snow on solid
foundation, cornices have been responsible
for many fatal accidents. De Luc’s party
naturally beat a hurried retreat; but “having
gathered, by reflection, that the addition of
our own weight to this prodigious mass which
had supported itself for ages counted for
absolutely nothing, and could not possibly
break it loose, we laid aside our fears and
went back to the terrible terrace.” A little
science is a dangerous thing; and it was a
mere chance that the first ascent of the Buet
is not notorious for a terrible accident. It
makes one’s blood run cold to read of the
calm contempt with which De Luc treated the
cornice. Each member of the party took it
in turn to advance to the edge and look over
on to the cliff below supported as to his coattails
by the rest of the party.</p>

<p>De Luc made a second ascent of the Buet,
two years later; but it was not until 1779
that a snow peak was again conquered. In
that year Murith, the Prior of the St. Bernard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Hospice, climbed the Velan, the broad-topped
peak which is so conspicuous a feature from
the St. Bernard. It is a very respectable
mountain rising to a height of 12,353 feet.
Murith, besides being an ecclesiastic, was
something of a scientist, and his botanical
handbook to the Valais is not without merit.
It is to Bourrit, of whom we shall speak
later, that we owe the written account of the
climb, based on information which Bourrit
had at first hand from M. Murith.</p>

<p>Murith started on August 30, 1779, with
“two hardy hunters,” two thermometers, a
barometer, and a spirit-level. They slept a
night on the way, and proceeded to attack
the mountain from the Glacier du Proz. The
hardy hunters lost their nerve, and tried to
dissuade M. Murith from the attempt; but
the gallant Prior replied: “Fear nothing;
wherever there is danger I will go in front.”
They encountered numerous difficulties,
amongst others a wall of ice which Murith
climbed by hacking steps and hand-holds
with a pointed hammer. One of the hardy
huntsmen then followed; his companion had
long since disappeared.</p>

<p>They reached the summit without further
difficulty, and their impressions of the view
are recorded by Bourrit in an eloquent passage
which recalls De Luc on the Buet, and once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
more proves that the early mountaineers were
fully alive to the glory of mountain tops&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A spectacle, no less amazing than magnificent,
offered itself to their gaze. The sky
seemed to be a black cloth enveloping the
earth at a distance from it. The sun shining
in it made its darkness all the more conspicuous.
Down below their outlook extended
over an enormous area, bristling with rocky
peaks and cut by dark valleys. Mont Blanc
rose like a sloping pyramid and its lofty head
appeared to dominate all the Alps as one
saw it towering above them. An imposing
stillness, a majestic silence, produced an
indescribable impression upon the mind. The
noise of the avalanches, reiterated by the
echoes, seemed to be the only thing that
marked the march of time. Raised, so to
say, above the head of Nature, they saw the
mountains split asunder, and send the fragments
rolling to their feet, and the rivers
rising below them in places where inactive
Nature seemed upon the point of death&mdash;though
in truth it is there that she gathers
strength to carry life and fertility throughout
the world.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is curious in this connection to notice
the part played by the Church in the early
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
history of mountaineering. This is not surprising.
The local curé lived in the shadow
of the great peaks that dominated his valley.
He was more cultured than the peasants of
his parish; he was more alive to the spiritual
appeal of the high places, and he naturally
took a leading part in the assaults on his
native mountains. The Titlis and Monte
Leone were first climbed by local monks.
The prior of the St. Bernard made, as we have
seen, a remarkable conquest of a great local
peak; and five years later M. Clément, the
curé of Champery, reached the summit of
the Dent du Midi, that great battlement of
rock which forms a background to the eastern
end of Lake Geneva. Bourrit, as we shall
see, was an ecclesiastic with a great love for
the snows. Father Placidus à Spescha was
the pioneer of the Tödi; and local priests played
their part in the early attempts on the Matterhorn
from Italy. “One man, one mountain”
was the rule of many an early pioneer; but
Murith’s love of the snows was not exhausted
by this ascent of the Velan. He had already
explored the Valsorey glacier with Saussure,
and the Otemma glacier with Bourrit. A few
years after his conquest of the Velan he
turned his attention to the fine wall of
cliffs that binds in the Orny glacier on the
south.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>Bourrit, who wrote up Murith’s notes on
the Velan, was one of the most remarkable
of this group of pioneers. He was a whole-hearted
enthusiast, and the first man who
devoted the most active years of his life to
mountaineering. He wins our affection by
the readiness with which he gave others due
credit for their achievements, a generous
characteristic which did not, however, survive
the supreme test&mdash;Paccard’s triumph on
Mont Blanc. Mountaineers at the end of the
eighteenth century formed a close freemasonry
less concerned with individual achievement
than with the furthering of common
knowledge. We have seen, for instance, that
De Saussure cared little who made the first
ascent of Mont Blanc provided that the way
was opened up for future explorers. Bourrit’s
actual record of achievement was small. His
exploration was attended with little success.
His best performance was the discovery, or
rediscovery of the Col de Géant. His great
ambition, the ascent of Mont Blanc, failed.
Fatigue, or mountain sickness, or bad weather,
spoiled his more ambitious climbs. But this
matters little. He found his niche in Alpine
history rather as a writer than as a mountaineer.
He popularised the Alps. He was
the first systematic writer of Alpine books, a
fact which earned him the title, “Historian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
of the Alps,” a title of which he was inordinately
proud. Best of all, in an age when
mountain appreciation was somewhat rare, he
marked himself out by an unbounded enthusiasm
for the hills.</p>

<p>He was born in 1735, and in one of his
memoirs he describes the moment when he
first heard the call of the Alps: “It was from
the summit of the Voirons that the view of
the Alps kindled my desire to become acquainted
with them. No one could give me
any information about them except that they
were the accursed mountains, frightful to look
upon and uninhabited.” Bourrit began life
as a miniature painter. A good many of his
Alpine water colours have survived. Though
they cannot challenge serious comparison
with the mountain masterpieces of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, they are
not without a certain merit. But Bourrit
would not have become famous had he not
deserted the brush for the pen. When the
Alps claimed him, he gave up miniatures, and
accepted an appointment as Precentor of
Geneva Cathedral, a position which allowed
him great leisure for climbing. He used to
climb in the summer, and write up his journeys
in the winter. He soon compiled a formidable
list of books, and was hailed throughout
Europe as the Historian of the Alps. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
was no absurd modesty about Bourrit. He
accepted the position with serene dignity.
His house, he tells us, is “embellished with
beautiful acacias, planned for the comfort
and convenience of strangers who do not
wish to leave Geneva without visiting the
Historian of the Alps.” He tells us that
Prince Henry of Prussia, acting on the advice
of Frederick the Great, honoured him with a
visit. Bourrit, in fact, received recognition
in many distinguished quarters. The Princess
Louise of Prussia sent him an engraving to
recall “a woman whom you have to some
extent taught to share your lofty sentiments.”
Bourrit was always popular with the ladies,
and no climber has shown a more generous
appreciation for the sex. “The sex is very
beautiful here,” became, as Mr. Gribble tells
us, “a formula with him as soon as he began
writing and continued a formula after he had
passed his threescore years and ten.”</p>

<p>We have said that Bourrit’s actual record
as a climber is rather disappointing. We
may forget this, and remember only his
whole-hearted devotion to the mountains.
Even Gesner, Petrarch, and Marti seem
balanced and cold when they set their tributes
besides Bourrit’s large enthusiasm. Bourrit
did not carry a barometer with him on his
travels. He did not feel the need to justify
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
his wanderings by collecting a mass of scientific
data. Nor did he assume that a mountain
tour should be written up as a mere guide-book
record of times and route. He is
supremely concerned with the ennobling effect
of mountain scenery on the human mind.</p>

<p>“At Chamounix,” he writes, “I have seen
persons of every party in the state, who
imagined that they loathed each other, nevertheless
treating one another with courtesy,
and even walking together. Returning to
Geneva, and encountering the reproaches of
their various friends, they merely answered
in their defence, ‘Go, as we have gone, to
the Montanvert, and take our share of the
pure air that is to be breathed there; look
thence at the unfamiliar beauties of Nature;
contemplate from that terrace the greatness
of natural objects and the littleness of man;
and you will no longer be astonished that
Nature has enabled us to subdue our passions.’
It is, in fact, the mountains that many men
have to thank for their reconciliation with
their fellows, and with the human race; and
it is there that the rulers of the world and the
heads of the nations ought to hold their
meetings. Raised thus above the arena of
passions and petty interests, and placed more
immediately under the influence of Divine
inspiration, one would see them descend from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
these mountains, each like a new Moses
bringing with them codes of law based upon
equity and justice.”</p>

<p>This is fine writing with a vengeance, just
as Ruskin’s greatest passages are fine writing.
Before we take our leave of Bourrit, let us see
the precentor of the cathedral exhorting a
company of guides with sacerdotal dignity.
One is irresistibly reminded of Japan, where
mountaineering and sacrificial rites go hand
in hand&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Historian of the Alps, in rendering
them this justice in the presence of a great
throng of people, seized the opportunity
of exhorting the new guides to observe the
virtues proper to their state in life. ‘Put
yourselves,’ he said to them, ‘in the place of
the strangers, who come from the most distant
lands to admire the marvels of Nature under
these wild and savage aspects; and justify the
confidence which they repose in you. You
have learnt the great part which these magnificent
objects of our contemplation play in
the organisation of the world; and, in pointing
out their various phenomena to their astonished
eyes, you will rejoice to see people raise
their thoughts to the omnipotence of the
Great Being who created them.’ The speaker
was profoundly moved by the ideas with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
which the subject inspired him, and it was
impossible for his listeners not to share in his
emotion.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us remember that Bourrit put his
doctrine into practice. He has told us that
he found men of diverse creeds reconciled
beneath the shadow of Mont Blanc. Bourrit
himself was a mountaineer first, and an
ecclesiastic second. Perhaps he was no
worse as a Protestant precentor because the
mountains had taught him their eternal
lessons of tolerance and serene indifference
to the petty issues which loom so large beneath
the shadow of the cathedral. Catholic
or Protestant it was all the same to our good
precentor, provided the man loved the hills.
Prior Murith was his friend; and every
Catholic mountaineer should be grateful to
his memory, for he persuaded one of their
archbishops to dispense climbers from the
obligation of fasting in Lent.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="large">THE STORY OF MONT BLANC</span></h2>

<p>The history of Mont Blanc has been made
the subject of an excellent monograph, and
the reader who wishes to supplement the
brief sketch which is all that we can attempt
should buy <i>The Annals of Mont Blanc</i>, by
Mr. C. E. Mathews. We have already seen
that De Saussure offered a reward in 1760 to
any peasant who could find a way to the
summit of Mont Blanc. In the quarter-of-a-century
that followed, several attempts were
made. Amongst others, Bourrit tried on two
occasions to prove the accessibility of Mont
Blanc. Bourrit himself never reached a
greater height than 10,000 feet; but some
of his companions attained the very respectable
altitude of 14,300 feet. De Saussure
attacked the mountain without success in
1785, leaving the stage ready for the entrance
of the most theatrical of mountaineers.</p>

<p>Jacques Balmat, the hero of Mont Blanc,
impresses himself upon the imagination as
no other climber of the day. He owes his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
fame mainly, of course, to his great triumph,
but also, not a little, to the fact that he was
interviewed by Alexandre Dumas the Elder,
who immortalised him in <i>Impressions de
Voyage</i>. For the moment, we shall not
bother to criticise its accuracy. We know
that Balmat reached the summit of Mont
Blanc; and that outstanding fact is about
the only positive contribution to the story
which has not been riddled with destructive
criticism. The story should be read in the
original, though Dumas’ vigorous French loses
little in Mr. Gribble’s spirited translation
from which I shall borrow.</p>

<p>Dumas visited Chamounix in 1883. Balmat
was then a veteran, and, of course, the great
person of the valley. Dumas lost no time in
making his acquaintance. We see them sitting
together over a bottle of wine, and we
can picture for ourselves the subtle art with
which the great interviewer drew out the old
guide. But Balmat shall tell his own story&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“H’m. Let me see. It was in 1786. I
was five-and-twenty; that makes me seventy-two
to-day. What a fellow I was! With the
devil’s own calves and hell’s own stomach.
I could have gone three days without bite or
sup. I had to do so once when I got lost on
the Buet. I just munched a little snow, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
that was all. And from time to time I looked
across at Mont Blanc saying, ‘Say what you
like, my beauty, and do what you like. Some
day I shall climb you.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>Balmat then tells us how he persuaded his
wife that he was on his way to collect crystals.
He climbed steadily throughout the day, and
night found him on a great snowfield somewhere
near the Grand Plateau. The situation
was sufficiently serious. To be benighted on
Mont Blanc is a fate which would terrify a
modern climber, even if he were one of a large
party. Balmat was alone, and the mental
strain of a night alone on a glacier can only
be understood by those who have felt the
uncanny terror that often attacks the solitary
wanderer even in the daytime. Fortunately,
Balmat does not seem to have been bothered
with nerves. His fears expressed themselves
in tangible shape.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Presently the moon rose pale and encircled
by clouds, which hid it altogether at about
eleven o’clock. At the same time a rascally
mist came on from the Aiguille du Gouter,
which had no sooner reached me than it began
to spit snow in my face. Then I wrapped my
head in my handkerchief, and said: ‘Fire
away. You’re not hurting me.’ At every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
instant I heard the falling avalanches making
a noise like thunder. The glaciers split, and
at every split I felt the mountain move. I
was neither hungry nor thirsty; and I had an
extraordinary headache which took me at
the crown of the skull, and worked its way
down to the eyelids. All this time, the mist
never lifted. My breath had frozen on my
handkerchief; the snow had made my clothes
wet; I felt as if I were naked. Then I redoubled
the rapidity of my movements, and
began to sing, in order to drive away the
foolish thoughts that came into my head. My
voice was lost in the snow; no echo answered
me. I held my tongue, and was afraid. At
two o’clock the sky paled towards the east.
With the first beams of day, I felt my courage
coming back to me. The sun rose, battling
with the clouds which covered the mountain
top; my hope was that it would scatter them;
but at about four o’clock the clouds got
denser, and I recognised that it would be
impossible for me just then to go any further.”</p></blockquote>

<p>He spent a second night on the mountain,
which was, on the whole, more comfortable
than the first, as he passed it on the rocks of
the Montagne de la Côte. Before he returned
home, Balmat planned a way to the summit.
And now comes the most amazing part of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
story. He had no sooner returned home than
he met three men starting off for the mountain.
A modern mountaineer, who had spent two
nights, alone, high up on Mont Blanc, would
consider himself lucky to reach Chamounix
alive; once there, he would go straight to bed
for some twenty-four hours. But Balmat was
built of iron. He calmly proposed to accompany
his friends; and, having changed his
stockings, he started out again for the great
mountain, on which he had spent the previous
two nights. The party consisted of François
Paccard, Joseph Carrier, and Jean Michel
Tournier. They slept on the mountain; and
next morning they were joined by two other
guides, Pierre Balmat and Marie Couttet.
They did not get very far, and soon turned
back&mdash;all save Balmat. Balmat, who seems
to have positively enjoyed his nights on the
glacier, stayed behind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I laid my knapsack on the snow, drew
my handkerchief over my face like a curtain,
and made the best preparations that I could
for passing a night like the previous one.
However, as I was about two thousand feet
higher, the cold was more intense; a fine
powdery snow froze me; I felt a heaviness
and an irresistible desire to sleep; thoughts,
sad as death, came into my mind, and I knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
well that these sad thoughts and this desire
to sleep were a bad sign, and that if I had
the misfortune to close my eyes I should
never open them again. From the place
where I was, I saw, ten thousand feet below
me, the lights of Chamounix, where my comrades
were warm and tranquil by their firesides
or in their beds. I said to myself:
‘Perhaps there is not a man among them
who gives a thought to me. Or, if there
is one of them who thinks of Balmat, no
doubt he pokes his fire into a blaze, or draws
his blanket over his ears, saying, ‘That ass of
a Jacques is wearing out his shoe leather.
Courage, Balmat!’”</p></blockquote>

<p>Balmat may have been a braggart, but it
is sometimes forgotten by his critics that he
had something to brag about. Even if he
had never climbed Mont Blanc, this achievement
would have gone down to history as
perhaps the boldest of all Alpine adventures.
To sleep one night, alone, above the snow line
is a misfortune that has befallen many
climbers. Some have died, and others have
returned, thankful. One may safely say that
no man has started out for the same peak,
and willingly spent a third night under even
worse conditions than the first. Three nights
out of four in all. We are charitably assuming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
that this part of Balmat’s story is true.
There is at least no evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, Balmat did not prosecute
the attempt at once. He returned to
Chamounix, and sought out the local doctor,
Michel Paccard. Paccard agreed to accompany
him. They left Chamounix at five in
the evening, and slept on the top of the
Montagne de la Côte. They started next
morning at two o’clock. According to Balmat’s
account, the doctor played a sorry
part in the day’s climb. It was only by some
violent encouragement that he was induced
to proceed at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“After I had exhausted all my eloquence,
and saw that I was only losing my time, I
told him to keep moving about as best he
could. He heard without understanding, and
kept answering ‘Yes, yes,’ in order to get rid
of me. I perceived that he must be suffering
from cold. So I left him the bottle, and set
off alone, telling him that I would come back
and look for him. ‘Yes, yes,’ he answered.
I advised him not to sit still, and started off.
I had not gone thirty steps before I turned
round and saw that, instead of running about
and stamping his feet, he had sat down, with
his back to the wind&mdash;a precaution of a sort.
From that minute onwards, the track presented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
no great difficulty; but, as I rose higher and
higher, the air became more and more unfit
to breathe. Every few steps, I had to stop
like a man in a consumption. It seemed to
me that I had no lungs left, and that my chest
was hollow. Then I folded my handkerchief
like a scarf, tied it over my mouth and breathed
through it; and that gave me a little relief.
However, the cold gripped me more and more;
it took me an hour to go a quarter of a league.
I looked down as I walked; but, finding myself
in a spot which I did not recognise, I raised
my eyes, and saw that I had at last reached
the summit of Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>“Then I looked around me, fearing to find
that I was mistaken, and to catch sight of
some aiguille or some fresh point above me;
if there had been, I should not have had the
strength to climb it. For it seems to me that
the joints of my legs were only held in their
proper place by my breeches. But no&mdash;it was
not so. I had reached the end of my journey.
I had come to a place where no one&mdash;where
not the eagle or the chamois&mdash;had ever been
before me. I had got there, alone, without
any other help than that of my own strength
and my own will. Everything that surrounded
me seemed to be my property. I was the
King of Mont Blanc&mdash;the statue of this
tremendous pedestal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>“Then I turned towards Chamounix, waving
my hat at the end of my stick, and saw,
by the help of my glass, that my signals were
being answered.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Balmat returned, found the doctor in a
dazed condition, and piloted him to the summit,
which they reached shortly after six
o’clock.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was seven o’clock in the evening; we
had only two-and-a-half hours of daylight
left; we had to go. I took Paccard by the
arm, and once more waved my hat as a last
signal to our friends in the valley; and the
descent began. There was no track to guide
us; the wind was so cold that even the snow
on the surface had not thawed; all that we
could see on the ice was the little holes made
by the iron points of our stick. Paccard was
no better than a child, devoid of energy and
will-power, whom I had to guide in the easy
places and carry in the hard ones. Night was
already beginning to fall when we crossed the
crevasse; it finally overtook us at the foot
of the Grand Plateau. At every instant,
Paccard stopped, declaring that he could go
no further; at every halt, I obliged him to
resume his march, not by persuasion, for he
understood nothing but force. At eleven, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
at last escaped from the regions of ice, and
set foot upon <i>terra firma</i>; the last afterglow
of the sunset had disappeared an hour before.
Then I allowed Paccard to stop, and prepared
to wrap him up again in the blanket, when I
perceived that he was making no use whatever
of his hands. I drew his attention to the
fact. He answered that that was likely
enough, as he no longer had any sensation in
them. I drew off his gloves, and found that
his hands were white and, as it were, dead;
for my own part, I felt a numbness in the hand
on which I wore his little glove in place of
my own thick one. I told him we had three
frost-bitten hands between us; but he seemed
not to mind in the least, and only wanted to
lie down and go to sleep. As for myself,
however, he told me to rub the affected part
with snow, and the remedy was not far to
seek. I commenced operations upon him and
concluded them upon myself. Soon the blood
resumed its course, and with the blood, the
heat returned, but accompanied by acute
pain, as though every vein were being pricked
with needles. I wrapped my baby up in his
blanket, and put him to bed under the shelter
of a rock. We ate a little, drank a glass of
something, squeezed ourselves as close to
each other as we could, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>“At six the next morning Paccard awoke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
me. ‘It’s strange, Balmat,’ he said, ‘I hear
the birds singing, and don’t see the daylight.
I suppose I can’t open my eyes.’ Observe
that his eyes were as wide open as the Grand
Duke’s. I told him he must be mistaken, and
could see quite well. Then he asked me to
give him a little snow, melted it in the hollow
of his hand, and rubbed his eyelids with it.
When this was done, he could see no better
than before; only his eyes hurt him a great
deal more. ‘Come now, it seems that I am
blind, Balmat. How am I to get down?’ he
continued. ‘Take hold of the strap of my
knapsack and walk behind me; that’s what
you must do.’ And in this style we came
down, and reached the village of La Côte.
There, as I feared that my wife would be
uneasy about me, I left the doctor, who
found his way home by fumbling with his
stick, and returned to my own house. Then,
for the first time, I saw what I looked like.
I was unrecognisable. My eyes were red; my
face was black; my lips were blue. Whenever
I laughed or yawned, the blood spurted from
my lips and cheeks; and I could only see in
a dark room.”</p>

<p>“‘And did Dr. Paccard continue blind?’
‘Blind, indeed! He died eleven months ago,
at the age of seventy-nine, and could still
read without spectacles. Only his eyes were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
diabolically red.’ ‘As the consequence of his
ascent?’ ‘Not a bit of it.’ ‘Why, then?’
‘The old boy was a bit of a tippler.’ And
so saying Jacques Balmat emptied his third
bottle.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The last touch is worthy of Dumas; and the
whole story is told in the Ercles vein. As
literature it is none the worse for that. It
was a magnificent achievement; and we can
pardon the vanity of the old guide looking
back on the greatest moment of his life. But
as history the interview is of little value.
The combination of Dumas and Balmat was
a trifle too strong for what Clough calls “the
mere it was.” The dramatic unities tempt one
to leave Balmat, emptying his third bottle,
and to allow the merry epic to stand unchallenged.
But the importance of this first
ascent forces one to sacrifice romance for the
sober facts.</p>

<p>The truth about that first ascent had to
wait more than a hundred years. The final
solution is due, in the main, to three men,
Dr. Dübi (the famous Swiss mountaineer),
Mr. Freshfield, and Mr. Montagnier. Dr.
Dübi’s book, <i>Paccard wider Balmat, oder Die
Entwicklung einer Legende</i>, gives the last word
on this famous case. For a convenient summary
of Dr. Dübi’s arguments, the reader
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
should consult Mr. Freshfield’s excellent review
of his book that appeared in the <i>Alpine
Journal</i> for May 1913. The essential facts are
as follows. Dr. Dübi has been enabled to
produce a diary of an eye-witness of the great
ascent. A distinguished German traveller,
Baron von Gersdorf, watched Balmat and
Paccard through a telescope, made careful
notes, illustrated by diagrams of the route,
and, at the request of Paccard’s father, a
notary of Chamounix, signed, with his friend
Von Meyer, a certificate of what he had seen.
This certificate is still preserved at Chamounix,
and Von Gersdorf’s diary and correspondence
have recently been discovered at Görlitz.
Here is the vital sentence in his diary, as
translated by Mr. Freshfield: “They started
again [from the Petits Rochers Rouges], at
5.45 p.m., halted for a moment about every
hundred yards, <i>changed occasionally the leadership</i>
[the italics are mine], at 6.12 p.m. gained
two rocks protruding from the snow, and at
6.23 p.m. were on the actual summit.” The
words italicised prove that Balmat did not
lead throughout. The remainder of the
sentence shows that Balmat was not the first
to arrive on the summit, and that the whole
fabric of the Dumas legend is entirely false.</p>

<p>But Dumas was not alone responsible for
the Balmat myth. This famous fiction was,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
in the main, due to a well-known Alpine character,
whom we have dealt with at length in
our third chapter. The reader may remember
that Bourrit’s enthusiasm for mountaineering
was only equalled by his lack of success. We
have seen that Bourrit had set his heart on
the conquest of Mont Blanc, and that Bourrit
failed in this ambition, both before, and after
Balmat’s ascent. In many ways, Bourrit was
a great man. He was fired with an undaunted
enthusiasm for the Alps at a time when such
enthusiasm was the hall-mark of a select
circle. He justly earned his title, the Historian
of the Alps; and in his earlier years he was
by no means ungenerous to more fortunate
climbers. But this great failing, an inordinate
vanity, grew with years. He could just
manage to forgive Balmat, for Balmat was a
guide; but Paccard, the amateur, had committed
the unforgivable offence.</p>

<p>It was no use pretending that Paccard had
not climbed Mont Blanc, for Paccard had been
seen on the summit. Bourrit took the only
available course. He was determined to
injure Paccard’s prospects of finding subscribers
for a work which the doctor proposed
to publish, dealing with his famous climb.
With this in view, Bourrit wrote the notorious
letter of September 20, 1786, which first
appeared as a pamphlet, and was later published
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
in several papers. We need not reproduce
the letter. The main points which
Bourrit endeavoured to make were that the
doctor failed at the critical stage of the
ascent, that Balmat left him, reached the top,
and returned to insist on Paccard dragging
himself somehow to the summit; that Paccard
wished to exploit Balmat’s achievements, and
was posing as the conqueror of Mont Blanc;
that, with this in view, he was appealing for
subscribers for a book, in which, presumably,
Balmat would be ignored, while poor Balmat,
a simple peasant, who knew nothing of Press
advertisement, would lose the glory that was
his just meed. It was a touching picture;
and we, who know the real Balmat as a genial
<i>blageur</i>, may smile gently when we hear him
described as <i>le pauvre Balmat à qui l’on
doit cette découverte reste presque ignoré, et
ignore qu’il y ait des journalistes, des journaux,
et que l’on puisse par le moyen de ces trompettes
littéraires obtenir du Public une sorte d’admiration</i>.
De Saussure, who from the first gave
Paccard due credit for his share in the climb,
seems to have warned Bourrit that he was
making a fool of himself. Bourrit appears to
have been impressed, for he added a postscript
in which he toned down some of his remarks,
and conceded grudgingly that Paccard’s share
in the ascent was, perhaps, larger than he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
at first imagined. But this relapse into decent
behaviour did not survive an anonymous reply
to his original pamphlet which appeared in
the <i>Journal de Lausanne</i>, on February 24,
1787. This reply gave Paccard’s story, and
stung Bourrit into a reply which was nothing
better than a malicious falsehood. “Balmat’s
story,” he wrote, “seems very natural ...
and is further confirmed by an eye-witness,
M. le Baron de Gersdorf, who watched the
climbers through his glasses; and this stranger
was so shocked by the indifference (to use
no stronger word) shown by M. Paccard to
his companion that he reprinted my letter in
his own country, in order to start a subscription
in favour of poor Balmat.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, we now know what Gersdorf
saw through his glasses, and we also know
that Gersdorf wrote immediately to Paccard,
“disclaiming altogether the motive assigned
for his action in raising a subscription.”
Paccard was fortunately able to publish two
very effective replies to this spiteful attack.
In the <i>Journal de Lausanne</i> for May 18 he
reproduced two affidavits by Balmat, both
properly attested. These ascribe to Paccard
the honour of planning the expedition, and
his full share of the work, and also state that
Balmat had been paid for acting as guide.
The first of these documents has disappeared.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
The second, which is entirely in Balmat’s handwriting,
is still in existence. Balmat, later in
life, made some ridiculous attempt to suggest
that he had signed a blank piece of paper;
but the fact that even Bourrit seems to have
considered this statement a trifle too absurd
to quote is in itself enough to render such
a protest negligible. Besides, Balmat was
shrewd enough not to swear before witnesses
to a document which he had never seen. It
is almost pleasant to record that a dispute
between the doctor and Balmat, in the high
street of Chamounix, resulted in Balmat
receiving a well-merited blow on his nose
from the doctor’s umbrella, which laid him
in the dust. It is in some ways a pity that
Dumas did not meet Paccard. The incident
of the umbrella might then have been worked
up to the proper epic proportions.</p>

<p>This much we may now regard as proved.
Paccard took at least an equal share in the
great expedition. Balmat was engaged as a
guide, and was paid as such. The credit for
the climb must be divided between these two
men; and the discredit of causing strained
relations between them must be assigned to
Bourrit. Meanwhile, it is worth adding that
the traditions of the De Saussure family are
all in favour of Balmat. De Saussure’s
grandson stated that Balmat’s sole object in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
climbing Mont Blanc was the hope of pecuniary
gain. He even added that the main reason
for his final attempt with Paccard was that
Paccard, being an amateur, would not claim
half the reward promised by De Saussure.
As to Paccard, “everything we know of him,”
writes Mr. Freshfield, “is to his credit.” His
scientific attainments were undoubtedly insignificant
compared to a Bonnet or a De
Saussure. Yet he was a member of the
Academy of Turin, he contributed articles
to a scientific periodical published in Paris,
he corresponded with De Saussure about his
barometrical observations. He is described by
a visitor to Chamounix, in 1788, in the following
terms: “We also visited Dr. Paccard,
who gave us a very plain and modest account
of his ascent of Mont Blanc, for which bold
undertaking he does not seem to assume to
himself any particular merit, but asserts that
any one with like physical powers could have
performed the task equally well.” De Saussure’s
grandson, who has been quoted against
Balmat, is equally emphatic in his approval
of Paccard. Finally, both Dr. Dübi and
Mr. Freshfield agree that, as regards the
discovery of the route: “Paccard came first
into the field, and was the more enterprising
of the two.”</p>

<p>Bourrit, by the way, had not even the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
decency to be consistent. He spoiled, as we
have seen, poor Paccard’s chances of obtaining
subscribers for his book, and, later in life, he
quarrelled with Balmat. Von Gersdorf had
started a collection for Balmat, and part of
the money had to pass through Bourrit’s
hands. A great deal of it remained there.
Bourrit seems to have been temporarily inconvenienced.
We need not believe that he had
any intention of retaining the money permanently,
but Balmat was certainly justified in
complaining to Von Gersdorf. Bourrit received
a sharp letter from Von Gersdorf, and
never forgave Balmat. In one of his later
books, he reversed his earlier judgment and
pronounced in favour of Paccard.</p>

<p>Bourrit discredited himself by the Mont
Blanc episode with the more discerning of his
contemporaries. De Saussure seems to have
written him down, judging by the traditions
that have survived in his family. Wyttenbach,
a famous Bernese savant, is even more
emphatic. “All who know him realise Bourrit
to be a conceited toad, a flighty fool, a
bombastic swaggerer.” Mr. Freshfield, however,
quotes a kinder and more discriminating
criticism by the celebrated Bonnet, ending
with the words: <i>Il faut, néanmoins, lui tenir
compte de son ardeur et de son courage.</i>
“With these words,” says Mr. Freshfield,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
“let us leave ‘notre Bourrit’; for by his
passion for the mountains he remains one
of us.”</p>

<p>Poor Bourrit! It is with real regret that
one chronicles the old precentor’s lapses.
Unfortunately, every age has its Bourrit, but
it is only fair to remember that Bourrit often
showed a very generous appreciation of other
climbers. He could not quite forgive Paccard.
Let us remember his passion for the snows.
Let us forget the rest.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to record that De Saussure’s
old ambition was gratified, and that he
succeeded in reaching the summit of Mont
Blanc in July 1787. Nor is this his only great
expedition. He camped out for a fortnight
on the Col de Géant, a remarkable performance.
He visited Zermatt, then in a very uncivilised
condition, and made the first ascent of the
Petit Mont Cervin. He died in 1799.</p>

<p>As for Balmat, he became a guide, and in
this capacity earned a very fair income.
Having accumulated some capital, he cast
about for a profitable investment. Two perfect
strangers, whom he met on the high road,
solved his difficulty in a manner highly satisfactory
as far as they were concerned. They
assured him that they were bankers, and
that they would pay him five per cent. on his
capital. The first of these statements may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
have been true, the second was false. He
did not see the bankers or his capital again.
Shortly after this initiation into high finance,
he left Chamounix to search for a mythical
gold-mine among the glaciers of the valley
of Sixt. He disappeared and was never seen
again. He left a family of four sons, two of
whom were killed in the Napoleonic wars.
His great-nephew became the favourite guide
of Mr. Justice Wills, with whom he climbed
the Wetterhorn.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="large">MONTE ROSA AND THE BÜNDNER OBERLAND</span></h2>

<p>The conquest of Mont Blanc was the most
important mountaineering achievement of the
period; but good work was also being done
in other parts of the Alps. Monte Rosa, as
we soon shall see, had already attracted the
adventurous, and the Bündner Oberland gave
one great name to the story of Alpine adventure.
We have already noted the important
part played by priests in the conquest of the
Alps; and Catholic mountaineers may well
honour the memory of Placidus à Spescha as
one of the greatest of the climbing priesthood.</p>

<p>Father Placidus was born in 1782 at Truns.
As a boy he joined the Friars of Disentis, and
after completing his education at Einsiedeln,
where he made good use of an excellent
library, returned again to Disentis. As a
small boy, he had tended his father’s flocks
and acquired a passionate love for the
mountains of his native valley. As a monk,
he resumed the hill wanderings, which he
continued almost to the close of a long life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>He was an unfortunate man. The French
Revolution made itself felt in Graubünden;
and with the destruction of the monastery
all his notes and manuscripts were burned.
When the Austrians ousted the French, he was
even more luckless; as a result of a sermon
on the text “Put not your trust in princes”
he was imprisoned in Innsbruck for eighteen
months. He came back only to be persecuted
afresh. Throughout his life, his wide learning
and tolerant outlook invited the suspicion of
the envious and narrow-minded; and on his
return to Graubünden he was accused of
heresy. His books and his manuscripts were
confiscated, and he was forbidden to climb.
After a succession of troubled years, he returned
to Truns; and though he had passed his
seventieth year he still continued to climb.
As late as 1824, he made two attempts on the
Tödi. On his last attempt, he reached a gap,
now known as the Porta da Spescha, less than
a thousand feet below the summit; and from
this point he watched, with mixed feelings,
the two chamois hunters he had sent forward
reach the summit. He died at the age of
eighty-two. One wishes that he had attained
in person his great ambition, the conquest of
the Tödi; but, even though he failed on this
outstanding peak, he had several good performances
to his credit, amongst others the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
first ascent of the Stockgron (11,411 feet) in
1788, the Rheinwaldhorn (11,148 feet) in
1789, the Piz Urlaun (11,063 feet) in 1793, and
numerous other important climbs.</p>

<p>His list of ascents is long, and proves a
constant devotion to the hills amongst which
he passed the happiest hours of an unhappy
life. “Placidus à Spescha”&mdash;there was little
placid in his life save the cheerful resignation
with which he faced the buffetings of fortune.
He was a learned and broad-minded man; and
the mountains, with their quiet sanity, seem
to have helped him to bear constant vexation
caused by small-minded persons. These suspicions
of heresy must have proved very
wearisome to “the mountaineer who missed
his way and strayed into the Priesthood.” He
must have felt that his opponents were,
perhaps, justified, that the mountains had
given him an interpretation of his beliefs that
was, perhaps, wider than the creed of Rome,
and that he himself had found a saner outlook
in those temples of a larger faith to which he
lifted up his eyes for help. As a relief from
a hostile and unsympathetic atmosphere, let
us hope that he discovered some restful
anodyne among the tranquil broadness of the
upper snows. The fatigue and difficulties of
long mountain tramps exhaust the mind, to
the exclusion of those little cares which seem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
so great in the artificial life of the valley.
Certainly, the serene indifference of the hills
found a response in the quiet philosophy of his
life. Very little remains of all that he must
have written, very little&mdash;only a few words,
in which he summed up the convictions which
life had given him. “When I carefully consider
the fortune and ill-fortune that have
befallen me, I have difficulty in determining
which of the two has been the more profitable
since a man without trials is a man without
experience, and such a one is without insight&mdash;<i>vexatio
dat intellectum</i>.” A brave confession
of a good faith, and in his case no vain
utterance, but the sincere summary of a
philosophy which coloured his whole outlook
on life.</p>

<p>The early history of Monte Rosa has an
appeal even stronger than the story of Mont
Blanc. It begins with the Renaissance. From
the hills around Milan, Leonardo da Vinci had
seen the faint flush of dawn on Monte Rosa
beyond&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A thousand shadowy pencilled valleys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snowy dells in a golden air.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The elusive vision had provoked his restless,
untiring spirit to search out the secrets of
Monte Rosa. The results of that expedition
have already been noticed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>After Da Vinci there is a long gap.
Scheuchzer had heard of Monte Rosa, but
contents himself with the illuminating remark
that “a stiff accumulation of perpetual ice is
attached to it.” De Saussure visited Macunagna
in 1789, but disliked the inhabitants
and complained of their inhospitality. He
passed on, after climbing an unimportant
snow peak, the Pizzo Bianco (10,552 feet).
His story is chiefly interesting for an allusion
to one of the finest of the early Alpine expeditions.
In recent years, a manuscript containing
a detailed account of this climb has
come to light, and supplements the vague
story which De Saussure had heard.</p>

<p>Long ago, in the Italian valleys of Monte
Rosa, there was a legend of a happy valley,
hidden away between the glaciers of the great
chain. In this secret and magic vale, the
flowers bloomed even in winter, and the
chamois found grazing when less happy
pastures were buried by the snow. So ran
the tale, which the mothers of Alagna and
Gressoney told to their children. The discovery
of the happy valley was due to Jean
Joseph Beck. Beck was a domestic servant
with the soul of a pioneer, and the organising
talent that makes for success. He had heard
a rumour that a few men from Alagna had
determined to find the valley. Beck was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Gressoney man; and he determined that
Gressoney should have the honour of the
discovery. Again and again, in Alpine history,
we find this rivalry between adjoining
valleys acting as an incentive of great ascents.
Beck collected a large party, including “a
man of learning,” by name Finzens (Vincent).
With due secrecy, they set out on a Sunday
of August 1788.</p>

<p>They started from their sleeping places at
midnight, and roped carefully. They had
furnished themselves with climbing irons and
alpenstocks. They suffered from mountain
sickness and loss of appetite, but pluckily
determined to proceed. At the head of the
glacier, they “encountered a slope of rock
devoid of snow,” which they climbed. “It
was twelve o’clock. Hardly had we got to
the summit of the rock than we saw a grand&mdash;an
amazing&mdash;spectacle. We sat down to contemplate
at our leisure the lost valley, which
seemed to us to be entirely covered with
glaciers. We examined it carefully, but could
not satisfy ourselves that it was the unknown
valley, seeing that none of us had ever been
in the Vallais.” The valley, in fact, was none
other than the valley of Zermatt, and the pass,
which these early explorers had reached, was
the Lysjoch, where, to this day, the rock on
which they rested bears the appropriate name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
that they gave it, “The Rock of Discovery.”
Beck’s party thus reached a height of 14,000
feet, a record till Balmat beat them on Mont
Blanc.</p>

<p>The whole story is alive with the undying
romance that still haunts the skyline whose
secrets we know too well. The Siegfried
map has driven the happy valley further
afield. In other ranges, still uncharted, we
must search for the reward of those that cross
the great divides between the known and the
unknown, and gaze down from the portals
of a virgin pass on to glaciers no man has
trodden, and valleys that no stranger has
seen. And yet, for the true mountaineer
every pass is a discovery, and the happy
valley beyond the hills still lives as the embodiment
of the child’s dream. All exploration,
it is said, is due to the two primitive instincts
of childhood, the desire to look over the edge,
and the desire to look round the corner. And
so we can share the thrill that drove that
little band up to the Rock of Discovery. We
know that, through the long upward toiling,
their eyes must ever have been fixed on the
curve of the pass, slung between the guarding
hills, the skyline which held the great secret
they hoped to solve. We can realise the last
moments of breathless suspense as their
shoulders were thrust above the dividing wall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
and the ground fell away from their feet to
the valley of desire. In a sense, we all have
known moments such as this; we have felt
the “intense desire to see if the Happy Valley
may not lie just round the corner.”</p>

<p>Twenty-three years after this memorable
expedition, Monte Rosa was the scene of one
of the most daring first ascents in Alpine
history. Dr. Pietro Giordani of Alagna made
a solitary ascent of the virgin summit which
still bears his name. The Punta Giordani
is one of the minor summits of the Monte Rosa
chain, and rises to the respectable height of
13,304 feet. Giordani’s ascent is another
proof, if proof were needed, that the early
climbers were, in many ways, as adventurous
as the modern mountaineer. We find Balmat
making a series of solitary attempts on Mont
Blanc, and cheerfully sleeping out, alone, on
the higher snowfields. Giordani climbs, without
companions, a virgin peak; and another
early hero of Monte Rosa, of whom we shall
speak in due course, spent a night in a cleft of
ice, at a height of 14,000 feet. Giordani, by
the way, indited a letter to a friend from the
summit of his peak. He begins by remarking
that a sloping piece of granite serves him for
a table, a block of blue ice for a seat. After
an eloquent description of the view, he expresses
his annoyance at the lack of scientific
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
instruments, and the lateness of the hour
which alone prevented him&mdash;as he believed&mdash;from
ascending Monte Rosa itself.</p>

<p>Giordani’s ascent closes the early history
of Monte Rosa; but we cannot leave Monte
Rosa without mention of some of the men who
played an important part in its conquest.
Monte Rosa, it should be explained, is not a
single peak, but a cluster of ten summits of
which the Dufour Spitze is the highest point
(15,217 feet). Of these, the Punta Giordani
was the first, and the Dufour Spitze the last,
to be climbed. In 1817, Dr. Parrott made the
first ascent of the Parrott Spitze (12,643 feet);
and two years later the Vincent Pyramid
(13,829) was climbed by a son of that Vincent
who had been taken on Beck’s expedition
because he was “a man of learning.” Dr.
Parrott, it might be remarked in passing, was
the first man to reach the summit of Ararat,
as Noah cannot be credited with having
reached a higher point than the gap between
the greater and the lesser Ararat.</p>

<p>But of all the names associated with pioneer
work on Monte Rosa that of Zumstein is the
greatest. He made five attempts to reach
the highest point of the group, and succeeded
in climbing the Zumstein Spitze (15,004 feet)
which still bears his name. He had numerous
adventures on Monte Rosa, and as we have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
already seen, spent one night in a crevasse, at
a height of 14,000 feet. He became quite a
local celebrity, and is mentioned as such by
Prof. Forbes and Mr. King in their respective
books. His great ascent of the Zumstein
Spitze was made in 1820, thirty-five years
before the conquest of the highest point of
Monte Rosa.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="large">TIROL AND THE OBERLAND</span></h2>

<p>The story of Monte Rosa has forced us to
anticipate the chronological order of events.
We must now turn back, and follow the
fortunes of the men whose names are linked
with the great peaks of Tirol<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and of the
Oberland. Let us recapitulate the most important
dates in the history of mountaineering
before the opening of the nineteenth
century. Such dates are 1760, which saw the
beginning of serious mountaineering, with the
ascent of the Titlis; 1778, which witnessed
Beck’s fine expedition to the Lysjoch; 1779,
the year in which the Velan, and 1786, the
year in which Mont Blanc, were climbed. The
last year of the century saw the conquest of
the Gross Glockner, one of the giants of Tirol.</p>

<p>The Glockner has the distinction of being
the only great mountain first climbed by a
Bishop. Its conquest was the work of a jovial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
ecclesiastic, by name and style Franz Altgraf
von Salm-Reifferscheid Krantheim, Bishop of
Gurk, hereinafter termed&mdash;quite simply&mdash;Salm.
Bishop Salm had no motive but the
fun of a climb. He was not a scientist, and
he was not interested in the temperature at
which water boiled above the snow line,
provided only that it boiled sufficiently
quickly to provide him with hot drinks and
shaving water. He was a most luxurious
climber, and before starting for the Glockner
he had a magnificent hut built to accommodate
the party, and a <i>chef</i> conveyed from
the episcopal palace to feed them. They
were weather-bound for three days in these
very comfortable quarters; but the <i>chef</i>
proved equal to the demands on his talent.
An enthusiastic climber compared the dinners
to those which he had enjoyed when staying
with the Bishop at Gurk. There were eleven
amateurs and nineteen guides and porters in
the party. Their first attempt was foiled
by bad weather. On August 25, 1799, they
reached the summit, erected a cross, and disposed
of several bottles of wine. They then
discovered that their triumph was a trifle
premature. The Glockner consists of two
summits separated by a narrow ridge. They
had climbed the lower; the real summit was
still 112 feet above them. Next year the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
mistake was rectified; but, though the Bishop
was one of the party, he did not himself reach
the highest point till a few years later.</p>

<p>Four years after the Glockner had been
climbed, the giant of Tirol and the Eastern
Alps was overcome. The conquest of the
Ortler was due to a romantic fancy of Archduke
John. Just as Charles VII of France
deputed his Chamberlain to climb Mont
Aiguille, so the Archduke (who, by the way,
was the son of the Emperor Leopold II, and
brother of Francis II, last of the Holy Roman
emperors) deputed Gebhard, a member of
his suite, to climb the Ortler. Gebhard made
several attempts without success. Finally,
a chamois hunter of the Passeierthal, by
name Joseph Pichler, introduced himself to
Gebhard, and made the ascent from Trafoi
on September 28, 1804. Next year Gebhard
himself reached the summit, and took a
reading of the height by a barometer. The
result showed that the Ortler was higher than
the Glockner&mdash;a discovery which caused great
joy. Its actual height is, as a matter of fact,
12,802 feet. But the ascent of the Ortler
was long in achieving the popularity that it
deserved. Whereas the Glockner was climbed
about seventy times before 1860, the Ortler
was only climbed twice between Gebhard’s
ascent and the ascent by the Brothers Buxton
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
and Mr. Tuckett, in 1864. Archduke John,
who inspired the first ascent, made an unsuccessful
attempt (this time in person) on the
Gross Venediger, another great Tyrolese peak.
He was defeated, and the mountain was not
finally vanquished till 1841.</p>

<p>The scene now changes to the Oberland.
Nothing much had been accomplished in the
Oberland before the opening years of the
nineteenth century. A few passes, the Petersgrat,
Oberaarjoch, Tschingel, and Gauli, had
been crossed; but the only snow peaks whose
ascent was undoubtedly accomplished were
the Handgendgletscherhorn (10,806 feet) and
a peak whose identification is difficult. These
were climbed in 1788 by a man called Müller,
who was engaged in surveying for Weiss. His
map was a very brilliant achievement, considering
the date at which it appeared. The
expenses had been defrayed by a rich merchant
of Aarau, Johann Rudolph Meyer, whose sons
were destined to play an important part in
Alpine exploration. J. R. Meyer had climbed
the Titlis, and one of his sons made one of the
first glacier pass expeditions in the Oberland,
crossing the Tschingel in 1790.</p>

<p>J. R. Meyer’s two sons, Johann Rudolph
the second and Hieronymus, were responsible
for some of the finest pioneer work in the
story of mountaineering. In 1811 they made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
the first crossing of the Beich pass, the Lötschenlücke,
and the first ascent of the
Jungfrau. As was inevitable, their story
was disbelieved. To dispel all doubt, another
expedition was undertaken in the following
year. On this expedition the leaders were
Rudolph and Gottlieb Meyer, sons of J. R.
Meyer the second (the conqueror of the
Jungfrau), and grandsons of J. R. Meyer the
first. The two Meyers separated after crossing
the Oberaarjoch. Gottlieb crossed the Grünhornlücke,
and bivouacked near the site of
the present Concordia Inn. Rudolph made
his classical attempt on the Finsteraarhorn,
and rejoined Gottlieb. Next day Gottlieb
made the second ascent of the Jungfrau and
Rudolph forced the first indisputable crossing
of the Strahlegg pass from the Unteraar
glacier to Grindelwald.</p>

<p>To return to Rudolph’s famous attempt on
the Finsteraarhorn. Rudolph, as we have
seen, separated from his brother Gottlieb
near the Oberaarjoch. Rudolph, who was
only twenty-one at the time, took with him
two Valaisian hunters, by name Alois Volker
and Joseph Bortis, a Melchthal “porter,”
Arnold Abbühl, and a Hasle man. Abbühl
was not a porter as we understand the word,
but a <i>knecht</i>, or servant, of a small inn. He
played the leading part in this climb. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
party bivouacked on the depression known as
the Rothhornsattel, and left it next morning
when the sun had already struck the higher
summits, probably about 5 a.m. They descended
to the Studerfirn, and shortly before
reaching the Ober Studerjoch started to climb
the great eastern face of the Finsteraarhorn.
After six hours, they reached the crest of the
ridge. Meyer could go no further, and remained
where he was; while the guides
proceeded and, according to the accounts
which have come down to us, reached the
summit.</p>

<p>Captain Farrar has summed up all the
available evidence in <i>The Alpine Journal</i> for
August 1913. The first climber who attempted
to repeat the ascent was the well-known
scientist Hugi. He was led by the same
Arnold Abbühl, who, as already stated, took a
prominent part in Meyer’s expedition. Abbühl,
however, not only failed to identify the highest
peak from the Rothhornsattel, but, on being
pressed, admitted that he had never reached
the summit at all. In 1830, Hugi published
these facts and Meyer, indignant at the implied
challenge to his veracity, promised to produce
further testimony. But there the matter
dropped. Captain Farrar summarises the
situation with convincing thoroughness.</p>

<p>“What was the situation in 1812? We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
have an enthusiastic ingenuous youth attempting
an ascent the like of which in point of
difficulty had at that time never been, nor
was for nearly fifty years after, attempted.
He reaches a point on the arête without any
great difficulty; and there he remains, too
tired to proceed. About this portion of the
ascent, there is, save as to the precise point
gained, no question; and it is of this portion
alone Meyer is a first-hand witness. Three
of his guides go on, and return to him after
many hours with the statement that they had
reached the summit, or that is what he understands.
I shall examine later this point.
But is it not perfectly natural that Meyer
should accept their statement, that he should
swallow with avidity their claim to have
reached the goal of all his labours? He had,
as I shall show later, no reason to doubt them;
and, doubtless, he remained firm in his belief
until Hugi’s book appeared many years after.
At once, he is up in arms at Hugi’s questioning,
as he thinks, his own statements and his
guides’ claims. He pens his reply quoted
above, promises to publish his MS. and hopes
to produce testimony in support. Then comes
Hugi’s reply, and Meyer realises that his own
personal share in the expedition is not
questioned; but he sees that he may after all
have been misled by, or have misunderstood,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
his guides, and he is faced with the reported
emphatic denial of his leading guide, who was
at that time still living, and could have been
referred to. It may be said that he wrote to
Abbühl for the ‘testimony,’ and failed to
elicit a satisfactory reply. Thrown into
hopeless doubt, all the stronger because his
belief in his guide’s statement had been firmly
implanted in his mind all these nineteen years,
is it to be wondered at that he lets the matter
drop? He finds himself unable to get any
testimony, and realises that the publication
of his MS. will not supply any more reliable
evidence. One can easily picture the disenchanted
man putting the whole matter
aside in sheer despair of ever arriving at the
truth.”</p>

<p>We have no space to follow Captain Farrar’s
arguments. They do not seem to leave a
shadow of doubt. At the same time, Captain
Farrar acquits the party of any deliberate
intention to deceive, and admits that their
ascent of the secondary summit of the Finsteraarhorn
was a very fine performance. It
is noteworthy that many of the great peaks
have been attempted, and some actually
climbed for the first time, by an unnecessarily
difficult route. The Matterhorn was assailed
for years by the difficult Italian arête, before
the easy Swiss route was discovered. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
south-east route, which Meyer’s party attempted,
still remains under certain conditions,
a difficult rock climb, which may not unfitly
be compared in part with the Italian ridge of
the Matterhorn. The ordinary west ridge
presents no real difficulties.</p>

<p>The first complete ascent of the Finsteraarhorn
was made on August 10, 1829, by Hugi’s
two guides, Jakob Leuthold and Joh. Wahren.
Hugi remained behind, 200 feet below the
summit. The Hugisattel still commemorates
a pioneer of this great peak.</p>

<p>So much for the Meyers. They deserve
a high place in the history of exploration.
“It has often seemed to me,” writes Captain
Farrar, “that the craft of mountaineering,
and even more the art of mountaineering
description, distinctly retrograded for over
fifty years after these great expeditions of the
Meyers. It is not until the early ’sixties that
rocks of equal difficulty are again attacked.
Even then&mdash;witness Almer’s opinion as to
the inaccessibility of the Matterhorn&mdash;men
had not yet learned the axiom, which Alexander
Burgener was the first, certainly by
practice rather than by explicit enunciation,
to lay down, viz. that the practicability of
rocks is only decided by actual contact.
Meyer’s guides had a glimmering of this. It
is again not until the ’sixties that Meyer’s calm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
yet vivid descriptions of actualities are surpassed
by those brilliant articles of Stephen,
of Moore, of Tuckett, and by Whymper’s
great ‘Scrambles’ that are the glory of
English mountaineering.”</p>

<p>But perhaps the greatest name associated
with this period is that of the great scientist,
Agassiz. Agassiz is a striking example of the
possibilities of courage and a lively faith. He
never had any money; and yet he invariably
lived as if he possessed a comfortable competence.
“I have no time for making
money,” is one of his sayings that have
become famous. He was a native of Orbe,
a beautiful town in the Jura. His father was
a pastor, and the young Agassiz was intended
for the medical profession. He took the
medical degree, but remained steadfast in his
determination to become, as he told his father,
“the first naturalist of his time.” Humboldt
and Cuvier soon discovered his powers; in
due time he became a professor at Neuchâtel.
He married on eighty louis a year; but money
difficulties never depressed him. As a boy
of twenty, earning the princely sum of fifty
pounds a year, he maintained a secretary in
his employment, a luxury which he never
denied himself. Usually he maintained two
or three. At Neuchâtel, his income eventually
increased to £125 a year. On this, he kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
up an academy of natural history, a museum,
a staff of secretaries and assistants, a lithographic
and printing plant, and a wife. His
wife, by the way, was a German lady; and
it is not surprising that her chief quarrel with
life was a lack of money for household expenses.
The naturalist, who had no time for making
money, spent what little he had on the
necessities of his existence, such as printing
presses and secretaries, and left the luxuries
of the larder to take care of themselves. His
family helped him with loans, “at first,” we
are told, “with pleasure, but afterwards with
some reluctance.” Humboldt also advanced
small sums. “I was pleased to remain a
debtor to Humboldt,” writes Agassiz, a sentiment
which probably awakens more sympathy
in the heart of the average undergraduate
than it did in the bosom of Humboldt.</p>

<p>A holiday which Agassiz spent with another
great naturalist, Charpentier, was indirectly
responsible for the beginnings of the glacial
theory. Throughout Switzerland, you may
find huge boulders known as erratic blocks.
These blocks have a different geological
ancestry from the rocks in the immediate
neighbourhood. They did not grow like
mushrooms, and they must therefore have
been carried to their present position by some
outside agency. In the eighteenth century,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
naturalists solved all these questions by <i>a
priori</i> theories, proved by quotations from
the book of Genesis. The Flood was a
favourite solution, and the Flood was, therefore,
invoked to solve the riddle of erratic
blocks. By the time that Agassiz had begun
his great work, the Flood was, however,
becoming discredited, and its reputed operations
were being driven further afield.</p>

<p>The discovery of the true solution was due,
not to a scientist, but to a simple chamois
hunter, named Perrandier. He knew no
geology, but he could draw obvious conclusions
from straightforward data without
invoking the Flood. He had seen these
blocks on glaciers, and he had seen them many
miles away from glaciers. He made the only
possible deduction&mdash;that glaciers must, at
some time, have covered the whole of Switzerland.
Perrandier expounded his views to a
civil engineer, by name Venetz. Venetz
passed it on to Charpentier, and Charpentier
converted Agassiz. Agassiz made prompt
use of the information, so prompt that Charpentier
accused him of stealing his ideas. He
read a paper before the Helvetic Society, in
which he announced his conviction that the
earth had once been covered with a sheet of
ice that extended from the North Pole to
Central Asia. The scepticism with which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
this was met incited Agassiz to search for
more evidence in support of his theory. His
best work was done in “The Hôtel des
Neuchâtelois.” This hôtel at first consisted
of an overhanging boulder, the entrance of
which was screened by a blanket. The
hôtel was built near the Grimsel on the
medial moraine of the lower Aar glacier.
To satisfy Mrs. Agassiz, her husband eventually
moved into even more palatial quarters
to wit, a rough cabin covered with canvas.
“The outer apartment,” complains Mrs.
Agassiz, a lady hard to please, “boasted a
table and one or two benches; even a couple
of chairs were kept as seats of honour for
occasional guests. A shelf against the wall
accommodated books, instruments, coats, etc.;
and a plank floor on which to spread their
blankets at night was a good exchange for the
frozen surface of the glacier.” But the picture
of this strange <i>ménage</i> would be incomplete
without mention of Agassiz’s companions.
“Agassiz and his companions” is a phrase
that meets us at every turn of his history.
He needed companions, partly because he
was of a friendly and companionable nature,
partly, no doubt, to vary the monotony of
Mrs. Agassiz’s constant complaints, but
mainly because his ambitious schemes were
impossible without assistance. His work involved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
great expenditure, which he could only
recoup in part from the scanty grants allowed
him by scientific societies, and the patronage
of occasional wealthy amateurs. The first
qualification necessary in a “companion”
was a certain indifference as to salary, and
the usual arrangement was that Agassiz
should provide board and lodging in the hôtel,
and that, if his assistant were in need of
money, Agassiz should provide some if he
had any lying loose at the time. This at
least was the substance of the contract
between Agassiz, on the one hand, and
Edouard Desor of Heidelberg University, on
the other hand.</p>

<p>Desor is perhaps the most famous of the
little band. He was a political refugee,
“without visible means of subsistence.” He
was a talented young gentleman with a keen
interest in scientific disputes, and an eye for
what is vulgarly known as personal advertisement.
In other words he shared the very
human weakness of enjoying the sight of his
name in honoured print. Another companion
was Karl Vogt. Mrs. Agassiz had two great
quarrels with life. The first was a shortage
of funds, and the second was the impropriety
of the stories exchanged between Vogt and
Desors. Another companion was a certain
Gressly, a gentleman whose main charm for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Agassiz consisted in the fact that, “though
he never had any money, he never wanted
any.” He lived with Agassiz in the winter
as secretary. In summer he tramped the
Jura in search of geological data. He never
bothered about money, but was always prepared
to exchange some good anecdotes for
a night’s lodging. Eventually, he went mad
and ended his days in an asylum. Yet
another famous name, associated with Agassiz,
is that of Dollfus-Ausset, an Alsatian of
Mülhausen, who was born in 1797. His great
works were two books, the first entitled
<i>Materials for the Study of Glaciers</i>, and the
second <i>Materials for the Dyeing of Stuffs</i>. On
the whole, he seems to have been more
interested in glaciers than in velvet. He
made, with Desor, the first ascent of the
Galenstock, and also of the most southern
peak of the Wetterhorn, namely the Rosenhorn
(12,110 feet). He built many observatories
on the Aar glacier and the Theodule,
and he was usually known as “Papa Gletscher
Dollfus.”</p>

<p>Such, then, were Agassiz’s companions.
Humour and romance are blended in the
picture of the strange little company that
gathered every evening beneath the rough
shelter of the hôtel. We see Mrs. Agassiz
bearing with admirable resignation those inconveniences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
that must have proved a very
real sorrow to her orderly German mind.
We see Desor and Vogt exchanging broad
anecdotes to the indignation of the good lady;
and we can figure the abstracted naturalist,
utterly indifferent to his environment, and
only occupied with the deductions that may
be drawn from the movement of stakes driven
into a glacier. Let me quote in conclusion
a few words from a sympathetic appreciation
by the late William James (<i>Memories and
Studies</i>)&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Agassiz was a splendid example of the
temperament that looks forward and not
backwards, and never wastes a moment in
regrets for the irrevocable. I had the privilege
of admission to his society during the
Thayer expedition to Brazil. I well remember,
at night, as we all swung in our hammocks,
in the fairy like moonlight, on the deck of the
steamer that throbbed its way up the Amazon
between the forests guarding the stream on
either side, how he turned and whispered,
‘James, are you awake?’ and continued, ‘I
cannot sleep; I am too happy; I keep thinking
of these glorious plans.’...</p>

<p>“Agassiz’s influence on methods of teaching
in our community was prompt and decisive&mdash;all
the more so that it struck people’s imagination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
by its very excess. The good old way of
committing printed abstractions to memory
seems never to have received such a shock
as it encountered at his hands. There is
probably no public school teacher who will
not tell you how Agassiz used to lock a
student up in a room full of turtle shells or
lobster shells or oyster shells, without a book
or word to help him, and not let him out till he
had discovered all the truths which the objects
contained. Some found the truths after
weeks and months of lonely sorrow; others
never found them. Those who found them
were already made into naturalists thereby;
the failures were blotted from the book of
honour and of life. ‘Go to Nature; take the
facts into your own hands; look and see for
yourself’&mdash;these were the maxims which
Agassiz preached wherever he went, and their
effect on pedagogy was electric....</p>

<p>“The only man he really loved and had use
for was the man who could bring him facts.
To see facts, not to argue or <i>raisonniren</i> was
what life meant for him; and I think he often
positively loathed the ratiocinating type of
mind. ‘Mr. Blank, you are totally uneducated,’
I heard him say once to a student,
who had propounded to him some glittering
theoretic generality. And on a similar occasion,
he gave an admonition that must have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
sunk deep into the heart of him to whom it
was addressed. ‘Mr. X, some people perhaps
now consider you are a bright young man;
but when you are fifty years old, if they ever
speak of you then, what they will say will be
this: “That Mr. X&mdash;oh yes, I know him;
he used to be a very bright young man.”’
Happy is the conceited youth who at the
proper moment receives such salutary cold-water
therapeutics as this, from one who in
other respects is a kind friend.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So much for Agassiz. It only remains to
add that his companions were responsible
for some fine mountaineering. During these
years the three peaks of the Wetterhorn were
climbed, and Desor was concerned in two of
these successful expeditions. A far finer
expedition was his ascent of the Lauteraarhorn,
by Desor in 1842. This peak is connected
with the Schreckhorn by a difficult
ridge, and is a worthy rival to that well-known
summit. There were a few other virgin
climbs in this period, but the great age of
Alpine conquest had scarcely begun.</p>

<p>The connecting link between Agassiz and
modern mountaineering is supplied by Gottlieb
Studer, who was born in 1804, and died in
1890. His serious climbing began in 1823,
and continued for sixty years. He made a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
number of new ascents, and reopened scores
of passes, only known to natives. Most
mountaineers know the careful and beautiful
panoramas which are the work of his pencil.
He drew no less than seven hundred of these.
His great work, <i>Ueber Eis und Schnee</i>, a
history of Swiss climbing, is an invaluable
authority to which most of his successors in
this field are indebted.</p>

<p>The careful reader will notice the comparative
absence of the English in the climbs
which we have so far described. The coming
of the English deserves a chapter to itself.

<span class="large">THE COMING OF THE ENGLISH</span></h2>

<p>Mountaineering, as a sport, is so often
treated as an invention of Englishmen, that
the real facts of its origin are unconsciously
disguised. A commonplace error of the textbooks
is to date sporting mountaineering
from Mr. Justice Wills’s famous ascent of the
Wetterhorn in 1854. The Wetterhorn has
three peaks, and Mr. Justice Wills made
the ascent of the summit which is usually
climbed from Grindelwald. This peak, the
Hasle Jungfrau, is the most difficult of the
group but it is not the highest. In those
early days, first ascents were not recorded
with the punctuality and thoroughness that
prevails to-day; and a large circle of
mountaineers gave Mr. Justice Wills the
credit of making the first ascent of the Hasle
Jungfrau, or at least the first ascent from
Grindelwald. Curiously enough, the climb,
which is supposed to herald sporting mountaineering,
was only the second ascent of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Grindelwald route to the summit of a peak
which had already been climbed four times.
The facts are as follows: Desor’s guides
climbed the Hasle Jungfrau in 1844, and
Desor himself followed a few days after.
Three months before Wills’s ascent, the peak
was twice climbed by an early English
pioneer, Mr. Blackwell. Blackwell’s first
ascent was by the Rosenlaui route, which
Desor had followed, and his second, by the
Grindelwald route, chosen by Mr. Wills. On
the last occasion, he was beaten by a storm
within about ten feet of the top, ten feet
which he had climbed on the previous occasion.
He planted a flag just under the final cornice;
and we must give him the credit of the
pioneer ascent from Grindelwald. Mr. Wills
never heard of these four ascents, and believed
that the peak was still virgin when he
ascended it.</p>

<p>It would appear, then, that the so-called
first sporting climb has little claim to that
distinction. What, precisely, is meant by
“sporting” in this connection? The distinction
seems to be drawn between those
who climb a mountain for the sheer joy of
adventure, and those who were primarily
concerned with the increase of scientific
knowledge. The distinction is important;
but it is often forgotten that scientists, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
De Saussure, Forbes, Agassiz and Desor,
were none the less mountaineers because they
had an intelligent interest in the geological
history of mountains. All these men were
inspired by a very genuine mountaineering
enthusiasm. Moreover, before Mr. Wills’s
climb there had been a number of quite
genuine sporting climbs. A few Englishmen
had been up Mont Blanc; and, though most
of them had been content with Mont Blanc,
they could scarcely be accused of scientific
inspiration. They, however, belonged to the
“One man, one mountain, school,” and as
such can scarcely claim to be considered as
anything but mountaineers by accident. Yet
Englishmen like Hill, Blackwell, and Forbes,
had climbed mountains with some regularity
long before Mr. Wills made his great ascent;
and foreign mountaineers had already achieved
a series of genuine sporting ascents. Bourrit
was utterly indifferent to science; and
Bourrit was, perhaps, the first man who made
a regular practice of climbing a snow mountain
every year. The fact that he was not often
successful must not be allowed to discount
his sincere enthusiasm. Before 1840, no
Englishman had entered the ranks of regular
mountaineers; and by that date many of
the great Alpine monarchs had fallen. Mont
Blanc, the outer fortresses of Monte Rosa,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
the Finsteraarhorn, King of the Oberland,
the Ortler, and the Glockner, the great rivals
of the Eastern Alps, had all been conquered.
The reigning oligarchies of the Alps had
bowed their heads to man.</p>

<p>Let us concede what must be conceded;
even so, we need not fear that our share in
Alpine history will be unduly diminished.
Mr. Wills’s ascent was none the less epoch-making
because it was the fourth ascent of a
second-class peak. The real value of that
climb is this: It was one of the first climbs
that were directly responsible for the systematic
and brilliant campaign which was in
the main conducted by Englishmen. Isolated
foreign mountaineers had already done
brilliant work, but their example did not
give the same direct impetus. It was not
till the English arrived that mountaineering
became a fashionable sport; and the wide
group of English pioneers that carried off
almost all the great prizes of the Alps between
1854 and the conquest of the Matterhorn in
1865 may fairly date their invasion from
Mr. Justice Wills’s ascent, a climb which,
though not even a virgin ascent and by no
means the first great climb by an Englishman,
was none the less a landmark. Mr. Justice
Wills’s vigorous example caught on as no
achievement had caught on. His book, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
is full of spirited writing, made many converts
to the new sport.</p>

<p>There had, of course, been many enthusiasts
who had preached the sport before Mr.
Justice Wills climbed the Wetterhorn. The
earliest of all Alpine Journals is the <i>Alpina</i>,
which first expressed the impetus of the
great Alpine campaign. It appeared in 1806,
and survived for four years, though the name
was later attached to a magazine which has
still a large circulation in Switzerland. It
was edited by Ulysses von Salis; and it
contained articles on chamois-hunting, the
ascent of the Ortler, etc., besides reviews of
the mountain literature of the period, such
books, for instance, as those of Bourrit and
Ebel. “The Glockner and the Ortler,”
writes the editor, “may serve as striking
instances of our ignorance, until a few years
ago, of the highest peaks in the Alpine ranges.
Excluding the Gotthard and Mont Blanc, and
their surrounding eminences, there still remain
more than a few marvellous and colossal
peaks which are no less worthy of becoming
better known.”</p>

<p>From 1840, the number of Englishmen
taking part in high ascents increases rapidly;
and between 1854 and 1865 the great bulk
of virgin ascents stand to their credit, though
it must always be remembered that these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
ascents were led by Swiss, French and Italian
guides, who did not, however, do them till
the English arrived. Before 1840 a few
Englishmen climbed Mont Blanc; Mrs. and
Miss Campbell crossed the Col de Géant,
which had previously been reopened by
Mr. Hill; and Mr. Malkin crossed a few
glacier passes. But J. D. Forbes was really
the first English mountaineer to carry out
a series of systematic attacks on the upper
snows. Incidentally, his book, <i>Travels through
the Alps of Savoy</i>, published in 1843, was the
first book in the English language dealing
with the High Alps. A few pamphlets had
been published by the adventurers of Mont
Blanc, but no really serious work. Forbes
is, therefore, the true pioneer not only of
British mountaineering, but of the Alpine
literature in our tongue. He was a worthy
successor to De Saussure, and his interest in
the mountains was very largely scientific.
He investigated the theories of glacier motion,
and visited Agassiz at the “Hôtel des
Neuchâtelois.” On that occasion, if Agassiz
is to be believed, the canny Scotsman managed
to extract more than he gave from the genial
and expansive Switzer. When Forbes published
his theories, Agassiz accused him of
stealing his ideas. Desor, whose genius for
a row was only excelled by the joy he took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
in getting up his case, did not improve matters;
and a bitter quarrel was the result. Whatever
may have been the rights of the matter,
Forbes certainly mastered the theory of
glacier motion, and proved his thorough
grasp of the matter in a rather remarkable
way. In 1820, a large party of guides and
amateurs were overwhelmed by an avalanche
on the Grand Plateau, and three of the guides
disappeared into a crevasse. Their bodies
were not recovered. Dr. Hamel, who had
organised the party, survived. He knew
something of glacier motion, and ventured
a guess that the bodies of the guides would
reappear at the bottom of the glacier in
about a thousand years. He was just nine
hundred and thirty-nine years wrong in his
calculation. Forbes, having ascertained by
experiment the rate at which the glacier
moved, predicted that the bodies would
reappear in forty years. This forecast proved
amazingly accurate. Various remains reappeared
near the lower end of the Glacier
des Bossons in 1861, a fragment of a human
body, and a few relics came to light two years
later, and a skull, ropes, hat, etc., in 1865.
Strangely enough, this accident was repeated
in almost all its details in the famous Arkwright
disaster of 1866.</p>

<p>Forbes carried through a number of fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
expeditions. He climbed the Jungfrau with
Agassiz and Desor&mdash;before the little trouble
referred to above. He made the first passage
by an amateur of the Col d’Hérens, and the
first ascents of the Stockhorn (11,796 feet)
and the Wasenhorn (10,661 feet). Besides
his Alpine wanderings, he explored some of
the glaciers of Savoy. His most famous book,
<i>The Tour of Mont Blanc</i>, is well worth reading,
and contains one fine passage, a simile
between the motion of a glacier and the
life of man.</p>

<p>Forbes was the first British mountaineer;
but John Ball played an even more important
part in directing the activity of the English
climbers. He was a Colonial Under-Secretary
in Lord Palmerston’s administration; but he
gave up politics for the more exciting field
of Alpine adventure. His main interest in
the Alps was, perhaps, botanical; and his
list of first ascents is not very striking,
considering the host of virgin peaks that
awaited an enterprising pioneer. His great
achievement was the conquest of the first
great dolomite peak that yielded its secrets
to man, the Pelmo. He also climbed the
virgin Cima Tosa in the Brenta dolomites,
and made the first traverse of the Schwartztor.
He was the first to edit guidebooks for the
use of mountaineers, and his knowledge of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the Alps was surprisingly thorough. He
played a great part in the formation of the
Alpine Club, and in the direction of their
literary activity. He edited the classical
series of <i>Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers</i>, and a
series of excellent Alpine guides.</p>

<p>But the event which above all others
attracted the attention of Englishmen to the
Alps was Albert Smith’s ascent of Mont
Blanc. Albert Smith is the most picturesque
of the British mountaineers. He was something
of a <i>blagueur</i>, but behind all his vulgarity
lay a very deep feeling for the Alps. His
little book on Mont Blanc makes good reading.
The pictures are delightfully inaccurate
in their presentation of the terrors of Alpine
climbing; and the thoroughly sincere fashion
in which the whole business of climbing is
written up proves that the great white
mountain had not yet lost its prestige. But
we can forgive Albert Smith a great deal, for
he felt the glamour of the Alps long before
he had seen a hill higher than St. Anne’s, near
Chertsey. As a child, he had been given
<i>The Peasants of Chamouni</i>, a book which
rivalled <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> in his affections.
This mountain book fired him to anticipate
his subsequent success as a showman.
“Finally, I got up a small moving panorama
of the horrors pertaining to Mont Blanc ...
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
and this I so painted up and exaggerated in
my enthusiasm, that my little sister&mdash;who
was my only audience, but an admirable one,
for she cared not how often I exhibited&mdash;would
become quite pale with fright.” Time passed,
and Albert Smith became a student in Paris.
He discovered that his enthusiasm for Mont
Blanc was shared by a medical student; and
together they determined to visit the Mecca
of their dreams. They collected twelve
pounds apiece, and vowed that it should last
them for five weeks. They carried it about
with them entirely in five-franc pieces, chiefly
stuffed into a leathern belt round their
waists. Buying “two old soldiers’ knapsacks
at three francs each, and two pairs of
hobnailed shoes at five francs and a half,”
they started off on their great adventure.
Smith wisely adds that, “if there is anything
more delightful than travelling with plenty
of money, it is certainly making a journey of
pleasure with very little.”</p>

<p>They made the journey to Geneva in
seventy-eight hours by <i>diligence</i>. At Melun
they bought a brick of bread more than two
feet long. “The passengers paid three francs
each for their <i>déjeuner</i>, ours did not cost
ten sous.” At night, they slept in the empty
<i>diligence</i>. They meant to make that twelve
pounds apiece carry them some distance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
From Geneva they walked to Chamounix,
helped by an occasional friendly lift. Smith
was delighted with the realisation of childish
dreams. “Every step was like a journey
in fairyland.” In fact, the only disillusion
was the contrast between the Swiss peasant
of romance and the reality. “The Alpine
maidens we encountered put us more in
mind of poor law unions than ballads;
indeed, the Swiss villagers may be classed
with troubadours, minstrel pages, shepherdesses,
and other fabulous pets of small poets
and vocalists.” After leaving Chamounix,
Smith crossed the St. Bernard, visited Milan,
and returned with a small margin still left
out of the magic twelve pounds.</p>

<p>Albert Smith returned to London, took up
practice as a surgeon, wrote for <i>Punch</i>, and
acquired a big reputation as an entertainer
in <i>The Overland Mail</i>, written by himself and
founded on a journey to Egypt and Constantinople.
The songs and sketches made
the piece popular, and insured a long run.
At the close of the season he went to
Chamounix again, fully determined to climb
Mont Blanc. He was accompanied by William
Beverley, the artist, and was lucky to fall in
with some Oxford undergraduates with the
same ambition as himself. They joined
forces, and a party of twenty, including
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
guides, prepared for the great expedition.
Amongst other provisions, they took ninety-four
bottles of wine, four legs of mutton, four
shoulders of mutton, and forty-six fowls.
Smith was out of training, and suffered
terribly from mountain sickness. He was
horrified by the Mur de la Côte, which he
describes as “an all but perpendicular iceberg,”
and adds that “every step was gained
from the chance of a horrible death.” As
a matter of fact, the Mur de la Côte is a very
simple, if steep, snow slope. A good ski-runner
could, under normal conditions, descend
it on ski. If Smith had fallen, he
would have rolled comfortably to the bottom,
and stopped in soft snow. “Should the foot
or the baton slip,” he assures us, “there is
no chance for life. You would glide like
lightning from one frozen crag to another,
and finally be dashed to pieces hundreds of
feet below.” It is pleasant to record that
Smith reached the summit, though not without
considerable difficulty, and that his party
drank all the wine and devoured the forty-six
fowls, etc., before their successful return to
Chamounix.</p>

<p>Smith wrote an account of the ascent which
provoked a bitter attack in <i>The Daily News</i>.
Albert Smith was contrasted with De Saussure,
greatly to Smith’s disadvantage. The sober,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
practical Englishman of the period could only
forgive a mountain ascent if the climber
brought back with him from the heights,
something more substantial than a vision
of remembered beauty. A few inaccurate
readings of an untrustworthy barometer
could, perhaps, excuse a pointless exploit.
“Saussure’s observations,” said a writer in
<i>The Daily News</i>, “live in his poetical philosophy,
those of Mr. Albert Smith will be most
appropriately recorded in a tissue of indifferent
puns, and stale, fast witticisms with an incessant
straining after smartness. The aimless
scramble of the four pedestrians to the
top of Mont Blanc will not go far to redeem
the somewhat equivocal reputation of the
herd of English to risks in Switzerland for
a mindless, and rather vulgar, redundance of
animal spirits.” Albert Smith did not allow
the subject to drop. He turned Mont Blanc
into an entertainment at the Egyptian Hall,
an entertainment which became very popular,
and was patronised by the Queen.</p>

<p>Narrow-minded critics affect to believe
that Albert Smith was nothing more than a
showman, and that Mont Blanc was for him
nothing more than a peg on which to hang
a popular entertainment. This is not true.
Mr. Mathews does him full justice when he
says: “He was emphatically a showman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
from his birth, but it is not true he ascended
the mountain for the purpose of making
a show of it. His well-known entertainment
resulted from a lifelong interest which he
had taken in the great summit, of which he
never failed to speak or write with reverence
and affection.” Mr. Mathews was by no
means naturally prejudiced in favour of anybody
who tended to popularise the Alps, and
his tribute is all the more striking in consequence.
Albert Smith fell in love with Mont
Blanc long before he had seen a mountain.
Nobody can read the story of his first journey
with twelve pounds in his pocket, without
realising that Albert Smith, the showman,
loved the mountains with much the same
passion as his more cultured successors.
Mr. Mathews adds: “It is but just to his
memory to record that he, too, was a pioneer.
Mountaineering was not then a recognised
sport for Englishmen. Hitherto, any information
about Mont Blanc had to be sought
for in isolated publications. Smith brought
a more or less accurate knowledge of it, as it
were, to the hearths and homes of educated
Englishmen.... Smith’s entertainment gave
an undoubted impetus to mountaineering.”</p>

<p>While Smith was lecturing, a group of
Englishmen were quietly carrying through a
series of attacks on the unconquered citadels
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
of the Alps. In 1854 Mr. Justice Wills made
that ascent of the Wetterhorn which has
already been referred to. It is fully described
in Mr. Justice Wills’s interesting book,
<i>Wanderings among the High Alps</i>, and,
amongst other things, it is famous as the first
appearance in Alpine history of the great
guide, Christian Almer. Mr. Wills left
Grindelwald with Ulrich Lauener, a guide
who was to play a great part in Alpine adventure,
Balmat and Simond. “The landlord
wrung Balmat’s hand. ‘Try,’ said he,
‘to return all of you alive.’” Lauener
burdened himself with a “flagge” to plant
on the summit. This “flagge” resolved itself
on inspection into a very solid iron construction
in the shape of a banner, which Lauener
carried to the summit on the following day.
They bivouacked on the Enge, and climbed
next day without great difficulty, to the gap
between the two summits of the Wetterhorn,
now known as the Wettersattel. They made
a short halt here; and, while they were
resting, they noticed with surprise two men
working up the rocks they had just climbed.
Lauener at first supposed they were chamois
hunters; but a moment’s reflection convinced
the party that no hunter would seek
his prey on such unlikely ground. Moreover,
chamois hunters do not usually carry on their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
backs “a young fir-tree, branches, leaves,
and all.” They lost sight of the party and
continued their meal. They next saw the
two strangers on the snow slopes ahead,
making all haste to be the first on the summit.
This provoked great wrath on the part of
Mr. Wills’s guides, who believed that the
Wetterhorn was a virgin peak, a view also
shared by the two usurpers, who had heard
of the intended ascent and resolved to plant
their fir-tree side by side with the iron
“flagge.” They had started very early that
same morning, and hunted their quarry
down. A vigorous exchange of shouts and
threats resulted in a compromise. “Balmat’s
anger was soon appeased when he found they
owned the reasonableness of his desire that
they should not steal from us the distinction
of being the first to scale that awful peak;
and, instead of administering the fisticuffs
he had talked about, he declared they were
<i>bons enfants</i> after all, and presented them
with a cake of chocolate. Thus the pipe of
peace was smoked, and tranquillity reigned
between the rival forces.”</p>

<p>From their resting-place they could see the
final summit. From this point a steep snow
slope, about three to four hundred feet in
height, rises to the final crest, which is usually
crowned by a cornice. The little party made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
their way up the steep slope, till Lauener
reached the final cornice. It should, perhaps,
be explained, that a cornice is a projecting
cave of wind-blown snow which is usually
transformed by sun and frost into ice.
Lauener “stood close, not facing the parapet,
but turned half round, and struck out as
far away from himself as he could....
Suddenly, a startling cry of surprise and
triumph rang through the air. A great
block of ice bounded from the top of the
parapet, and before it had well lighted on
the glacier, Lauener exclaimed ‘Ich schaue
den Blauen Himmel’ (‘I see blue sky’). A
thrill of astonishment and delight ran through
our frames. Our enterprise had succeeded.
We were almost upon the actual summit.
That wave above us, frozen, as it seemed, in
the act of falling over, into a strange and
motionless magnificence, was the very peak
itself. Lauener’s blows flew with redoubled
energy. In a few minutes a practicable
breach was made, through which he disappeared;
and in a moment more the sound
of his axe was heard behind the battlement
under whose cover we stood. In his excitement
he had forgotten us, and very soon the
whole mass would have come crashing down
upon our heads. A loud shout of warning
from Sampson, who now occupied the gap,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
was echoed by five other eager voices, and
he turned his energies in a safer direction.
It was not long before Lauener and Sampson
together had widened the opening; and then
at length we crept slowly on. As I took the
last step Balmat disappeared from my sight;
my left shoulder grazed against the angle of
the icy embrasure, while on the right the
glacier fell abruptly away beneath me towards
an unknown and awful abyss; a hand from
an invisible person grasped mine; I stepped
across, and had passed the ridge of the
Wetterhorn.</p>

<p>“The instant before I had been face to
face with a blank wall of ice. One step,
and the eye took in a boundless expanse of
crag and glacier, peak and precipice, mountain
and valley, lake and plain. The whole world
seemed to lie at my feet. The next moment,
I was almost appalled by the awfulness of
our position. The side we had come up was
steep; but it was a gentle slope compared
with that which now fell away from where I
stood. A few yards of glittering ice at our
feet, and then nothing between us and the
green slopes of Grindelwald nine thousand
feet beneath.”</p>

<p>The “iron flagge” and fir-tree were
planted side by side, and attracted great
attention in Grindelwald. The “flagge”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
they could understand, but the fir-tree greatly
puzzled them.</p>

<p>Christian Almer, the hero of the fir-tree,
was destined to be one of the great Alpine
guides. His first ascents form a formidable
list, and include the Eiger, Mönch, Fiescherhorn
in the Oberland (besides the first ascent
of the Jungfrau direct from the Wengern
Alp), the Ecrins, monarch of the Dauphiny,
the Grand Jorasses, Col Dolent, Aiguille
Verte in the Mont Blanc range, the Ruinette,
and Morning Pass in the Pennines. But
Almer’s most affectionate recollections always
centred round the Wetterhorn. The present
writer remembers meeting him on his way to
celebrate his golden wedding, on the summit
of his first love. Almer also deserves to be
remembered as a pioneer of winter mountaineering.
He made with Mr. Coolidge the
first winter ascents of the Jungfrau and
Wetterhorn. It was on a winter ascent of
the former peak that he incurred frostbite,
that resulted in the amputation of his toes,
and the sudden termination of his active
career. Some years later he died peaceably
in his bed.</p>

<p>A year after Mr. Wills’s famous climb,
a party of Englishmen, headed by the brothers
Smyth, conquered the highest point of Monte
Rosa. The Alpine campaign was fairly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
opened. Hudson made a new route up
Mont Blanc without guides, the first great
guideless climb by Englishmen. Hinchcliffe,
the Mathews, E. S. Kennedy, and others,
had already done valuable work.</p>

<p>The Alpine Club was the natural result of
the desire on the part of these climbers to
meet together in London and compare notes.
The idea was first mooted in a letter from
Mr. William Mathews to the Rev. J. A. Hort.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
The first meeting was held on December 22,
1857. The office of President was left open
till it was deservedly filled by John Ball;
E. S. Kennedy became Vice-President, and
Mr. Hinchcliffe, Honorary Secretary. It is
pleasant to record that Albert Smith, the
showman, was an original member. The
English pioneers prided themselves, not without
some show of justification, on the fact
that their sport attracted men of great
intellectual powers. Forbes, Tyndall, and
Leslie Stephen, are great names in the record
of Science and Literature. The present
Master of Trinity was one of the early members,
his qualification being an ascent of
Monte Rosa, Sinai, and Parnassus.</p>

<p>There were some remarkable men in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
early group of English mountaineers. Of
John Ball and Albert Smith, we have already
spoken. Perhaps the most distinguished
mountaineer from the standpoint of the
outside world was John Tyndall. Tyndall
was not only a great scientist, and one of the
foremost investigators of the theory of glacier
motion, he was also a fine mountaineer.
His finest achievement was the first ascent
of the Weishorn; and he also played a great
part in the long struggle for the blue ribbon
of the Alps&mdash;the Matterhorn. His book,
<i>Hours of Exercise in the Alps</i>, makes good
reading when once one has resigned oneself
to the use of somewhat pedantic terms for
quite simple operations. Somewhere or other&mdash;I
quote from memory&mdash;a guide’s legs are
referred to as monstrous levers that projected
his body through space with enormous
velocity! Tyndall, by the way, chose to
take offence at some light-hearted banter
which Leslie Stephen aimed at the scientific
mountaineers. The passage occurs in
Stephen’s chapter on the Rothhorn. “‘And
what philosophic observations did you make?’
will be the inquiry of one of those fanatics
who by a process of reasoning to me utterly
inscrutable have somehow irrevocably associated
Alpine travelling with science. To them,
I answer, that the temperature was approximately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
(I had no thermometer) 212 degrees
Fahrenheit below freezing point. As for
ozone, if any existed in the atmosphere, it
was a greater fool than I take it for.” This
flippancy caused a temporary breach between
Stephen and Tyndall which was, however,
eventually healed.</p>

<p>Leslie Stephen is, perhaps, best known as
a writer on ethics, though his numerous
works of literary criticism contain much that
is brilliant and little that is unsound. It
has been said that the popularity of the
word “Agnostic” is due less to Huxley, who
invented it, than to Leslie Stephen who
popularised it in his well known <i>Agnostic’s
Apology</i>, an important landmark in the history
of English Rationalism. The present writer
has read almost every line that Stephen
wrote, and yet feels that it is only in <i>The
Playground of Europe</i> that he really let himself
go. Though Stephen had a brilliant
record as a mountaineer, it is this book that
is his best claim to the gratitude and honour
of climbers. Stephen was a fine mountaineer,
as well as a distinguished writer. He was
the first to climb the Shreckhorn, Zinal
Rothhorn, Bietschhorn, Blüemlisalp, Rimphischorn,
Disgrazia, and Mont Malet. He had
the true mountaineering instinct, which is
always stirred by the sight of an uncrossed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
pass; and that great wall of rock and ice
that shadows the Wengern Alp always suggests
Stephen, for it falls in two places to
depressions which he was the first to cross,
passes immortalised in the chapters dealing
with “The Jungfraujoch” and “The
Eigerjoch.”</p>

<p>It is not easy to stop if one begins to
catalogue the distinguished men who helped
to build up the triumphs of this period.
Professor Bonney, an early president, was a
widely travelled mountaineer, and a scientist
of world-wide reputation. His recent work
on the geology of the Alps, is perhaps the best
book of the kind in existence. The Rev.
Fenton Hort had, as we have seen, a great deal
to do with the formation of the Alpine Club.
His life has been written by his son, Sir
Arthur Hort. Of John Ball and Mr. Justice
Wills, we have already spoken. Of Whymper
we shall have enough to say when we summarise
the great romance of the Matterhorn.
He was a remarkable man, with iron determination
and great intellectual gifts. His
classic <i>Scrambles in the Alps</i> did more than
any other book to make new mountaineers.
He was one of the first draughtsmen who
combined a mountaineer’s knowledge of rock
and ice with the necessary technical ability
to reproduce the grandeur of the Alps in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
black and white. One should compare the
delightful woodcuts from his sketches with
the crude, shapeless engravings that decorate
<i>Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers</i>. His great book
deserved its success. Whymper himself was
a strong personality. He had many good
qualities and some that laid him open to
criticism. He made enemies without much
difficulty. But he did a great work, and no
man has a finer monument to keep alive the
memory of his most enduring triumphs.</p>

<p>Another name which must be mentioned
is that of Mr. C. E. Mathews, a distinguished
pioneer whose book on Mont Blanc has been
quoted in an earlier chapter. He was a
most devoted lover of the great mountain,
and climbed it no less than sixteen times.
He was a rigid conservative in matters
Alpine; and there is something rather engaging
in his contempt for the humbler
visitors to the Alps. “It is a scandal to the
Republic,” he writes, “that a line should
have been permitted between Grindelwald
and Interlaken. Alas for those who hailed
with delight the extension of the Rhone
Valley line from Sion to Visp!” It would
have been interesting to hear his comments
on the Jungfrau railway. The modern
mountaineer would not easily forego the
convenience of the trains to Zermatt that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
save him many hours of tiresome, if romantic,
driving.</p>

<p>Then there is Thomas Hinchcliffe, whose
<i>Summer Months in the Alps</i> gave a decided
impetus to the new movement. He belongs
to a slightly earlier period than A. W. Moore,
one of the most distinguished of the early
group. Moore attained a high and honourable
position in the Home Office. His book
<i>The Alps in 1864</i>, which has recently been
reprinted, is one of the sincerest tributes to
the romance of mountaineering in the English
language. Moore took part in a long list
of first ascents. He was a member of the
party that achieved the first ascent of the
Ecrins which Whymper has immortalised,
and he had numerous other virgin ascents
to his credit. His most remarkable feat was
the first ascent of Mont Blanc by the Brenva
ridge, the finest ice expedition of the period.
Mr. Mason has immortalised the Brenva in
his popular novel, <i>Running Water</i>.</p>

<p>And so the list might be indefinitely extended,
if only space permitted. There was
Sir George Young, who took part in the first
ascent of the Jungfrau from the Wengern
Alp and who was one of the first to attempt
guideless climbing. There was Hardy, who
made the first English ascent of the Finsteraarhorn,
and Davies who climbed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
two loftiest Swiss peaks, Dom and Täschhorn.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
“What I don’t understand,” he said
to a friend of the present writer, “is why
you modern mountaineers always climb on
a rope. Surely your pace must be that of the
slowest member of the party?” One has a
picture of Davies striding impatiently ahead,
devouring the ground in great hungry strides,
while the weaker members dwindled into
small black spots on the face of the glacier.
And then there is Tuckett, who died in 1913.
Of Tuckett, Leslie Stephen wrote: “In the
heroic cycle of Alpine adventure the irrepressible
Tuckett will occupy a place similar
to Ulysses. In one valley the peasant will
point to some vast breach in the everlasting
rocks hewn, as his fancy will declare, by the
sweep of the mighty ice-axe of the hero....
The broken masses of a descending glacier
will fairly represent the staircase which he
built in order to scale a previously inaccessible
height.... Critics will be disposed to trace
in him one more example of the universal
solar myth.... Tuckett, it will be announced,
is no other than the sun which
appears at earliest dawn above the tops of
the loftiest mountains, gilds the summits of
the most inaccessible peaks, penetrates remote
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
valleys, and passes in an incredibly short time
from one extremity of the Alpine chain to
another.”</p>

<p>The period which closes with the ascent
of the Matterhorn in 1865 has been called
the Golden Age of Mountaineering; and the
mountaineers whom we have mentioned were
responsible for the greater portion of this
glorious harvest. By 1865 the Matterhorn
was the only remaining Zermat giant that
still defied the invaders; and beyond Zermat
only one great group of mountains, the
Dolomites, still remained almost unconquered.
It was the age of the guided climber. The
pioneers did excellent work in giving the
chamois hunter the opportunity to become
a guide. And many of these amateurs were
really the moral leaders of their parties.
It was sometimes, though not often, the
amateur who planned the line of ascent, and
decided when the attack should be pressed
and when it should be abandoned. It was
only when the guide had made repeated
ascents of fashionable peaks that the part
played by the amateur became less and less
important. Mountaineering in the ’fifties
and ’sixties was in many ways far more
arduous than it is to-day. Club-huts are
now scattered through the Alps. It is no
longer necessary to carry firewood and sleeping-bags
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to some lonely bivouac beside the
banks of great glaciers. A sudden gust of
bad weather at night no longer means that
the climber starts at dawn with drenched
clothes. The excellent series of <i>Climbers’
Guides</i> give minute instructions describing
every step in the ascent. The maps are
reliable. In those days, guide-books had
still to be written, the maps were romantic
and misleading, and the discoverer of a new
pass had not only to get to the top, he had also
to get down the other side. What precisely
lay beyond the pass, he did not know. It
might be an impassable glacier, or a rock
face that could not be descended. Almost
every new pass involved the possibility of
a forced bivouac.</p>

<p>None the less, it must be admitted that the
art of mountaineering has advanced more
since 1865 than it did in the preceding half
century. There is a greater difference between
the ascent of the Grepon by the Mer de
Glace Face, or the Brouillard Ridge of Mont
Blanc, than between the Matterhorn and the
Gross Glockner, or between the Weishorn and
Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>The art of mountaineering is half physical
and half mental. He who can justly claim the
name of mountaineer must possess the power to
<i>lead</i> up rocks and snow, and to cut steps in ice.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
This is the physical side of the business. It
is important; but the charm of mountaineering
is largely intellectual. The mental equipment
of the mountaineer involves an exhaustive
knowledge of one of the most ruthless
aspects of Nature. The mountaineer must
know the hills in all their changing moods
and tenses. He must possess the power to
make instant use of trivial clues, a power
which the uninitiated mistake for an instinctive
sense of direction. Such a sense is
undoubtedly possessed by a small minority,
but path-finding is often usually only the
subconscious analysis of small clues. The
mountaineer must understand the secrets of
snow, rock, and ice. He must be able to tell
at a glance whether a snow slope is dangerous,
or a snow-bridge likely to collapse. He must
be able to move with certainty and safety on
a rock face, whether it is composed of reliable,
or brittle and dangerous rock. All this
involves knowledge which is born of experience
and the power to apply experience.
Every new peak is a problem for the intellect.
Mountaineering, however, differs radically in
one respect from many other sports. Most
men can get up a mountain somehow, and
thereby share at least one experience of the
expert. Of every hundred boys that are
dragooned into compulsory cricket at school,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
only ten could ever by any possible chance
qualify to play in first-class cricket. Almost
all of them could reach the summit of a first
class peak if properly guided.</p>

<p>But this is not mountaineering. You cannot
pay a professional to take your place at
Lords’ and then claim the benefit of the
century he knocks up. But some men with
great Alpine reputations owe everything to
the professional they have hired. They have
good wind and strong legs. With a stout
rope above, they could follow a good leader
up any peak in the Alps. The guide was
not only paid to lead up the rocks and assist
them from above. He was paid to do all
the thinking that was necessary. He was
the brain as well as the muscle of the expedition.
He solved all the problems that Nature
sets the climber, and mountaineering for his
client was only a very safe form of exercise
in agreeable surroundings.</p>

<p>Leslie Stephen admitted this, and he had
less cause to admit it than most. “I utterly
repudiate the doctrine that Alpine travellers
are, or ought to be, the heroes of Alpine
adventure. The true way, at least, to describe
all my Alpine adventures is to say that
Michael Anderegg, or Lauener, succeeded in
performing a feat requiring skill, strength,
and courage, the difficulty of which was much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
increased by the difficulty of taking with him
his knapsack and his employer.” Now, this
does less than justice to Leslie Stephen, and
to many of the early mountaineers. Often
they supplied the brain of the party, and the
directing energy. They were pioneers. Yet
mountaineering as a fine art owes almost as
much to the men who first dispensed with
professional assistance. A man who climbs
habitually with guides may be, and often
is, a fine mountaineer. He <i>need</i> be nothing
more than a good walker, with a steady head,
to achieve a desperate reputation among
laymen.</p>

<p>Many of the early pioneers were by no
means great athletes, though their mountaineering
achievements deceived the public into
crediting them with superhuman nerve and
strength. Many of them were middle-aged
gentlemen, who could have taken no part in
active sports which demand a swift alliance
of nerve and muscle; but who were quite
capable of plugging up the average mixture
of easy rock and snow that one meets on the
average first-class Alpine peak. They had
average endurance, and more than average
pluck, for the prestige of the unvanquished
peaks still daunted all but the courageous.</p>

<p>They were lucky in that the great bulk of
Alpine peaks were unconquered, and were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
only too ready to be conquered by the first
climber who could hire two trusty Swiss
guides to cut the steps, carry the knapsack,
and lead up the rocks. It is usually said of
these men: “They could not, perhaps, have
tackled the pretty rock problems in which the
modern cragsman delights. They were something
better than gymnasts. They were all-round
mountaineers.” This seems rather
special pleading. Some one said that mountaineering
seemed to be walking up easy
snow mountains between guides, and mere
cragsmanship consisted in leading up difficult
rock-peaks without guides. It does not
follow that a man who can lead up the
Chamounix aiguilles knows less of the broader
principles of mountaineering than the gentleman
who is piloted up Mont Blanc by sturdy
Swiss peasants. The issue is not between
those who confine their energies to gymnastic
feats on Welsh crags and the wider school
who understand snow and ice as well as rock.
The issue is between those who can take their
proper share in a rock-climb like the Grepon,
or a difficult ice expedition like the Brenva
Mont Blanc, and those who would be completely
at a loss if their guides broke down
on an easy peak like the Wetterhorn. The
pioneers did not owe everything to their
guides. A few did, but most of them were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
good mountaineers whose opinion was often
asked by the professionals, and sometimes
taken. Yet the guided climber, then and
now, missed the real inwardness of the sport.
Mountaineering, in the modern sense, is a
sport unrivalled in its appeal to mind and
body. The man who can lead on a series of
really first-class climbs must possess great
nerve, and a specialised knowledge of
mountains that is almost a sixth sense.
Mountaineering between guides need not
involve anything more than a good wind and
a steady head. Anybody can get up a
first-class peak. Only one amateur in ten
can complete ascent and descent with safety
if called on to lead.</p>

<p>In trying to form a just estimate of our
debt to the early English pioneers, we have
to avoid two extremes. We must remember
the parable of the dwarf standing on the
giant’s shoulders. It ill becomes those who
owe Climbers’ Guides, and to some extent
good maps, to the labours of the pioneers to
discount their achievements. But the other
extreme is also a danger. We need not
pretend that every man who climbed a
virgin peak in the days when nearly every
big peak was virgin was necessarily a fine
mountaineer. All praise is due to the earliest
explorers, men like Balmat, Joseph Beck,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Bourrit, De Saussure, and the Meyers, for in
those days the country above the snow-line
was not only unknown, it was full of imagined
terrors. These men did a magnificent work
in robbing the High Alps of their chief
defence&mdash;superstition. But in the late ’fifties
and early ’sixties this atmosphere had largely
vanished. Mr. X came to the A valley, and
discovered that the B, C, or D horn had not
been climbed. The B, C, and D horn were
average peaks with a certain amount of
straightforward snow and ice work, and a
certain amount of straightforward rock work.
Mr. X enjoys a fortnight of good weather,
and the services of two good guides. He does
what any man with like opportunities would
accomplish, what an undergraduate fresh to
the Alps could accomplish to-day if these peaks
had been obligingly left virgin for his disposal.
Many of the pioneers with a long list of virgin
peaks to their credit would have made a poor
show if they had been asked to lead one of
the easy buttresses of Tryfan.</p>

<p>Rock-climbing as a fine art was really
undreamt of till long after the Matterhorn
had been conquered. The layman is apt to
conceive all Alpine climbs as a succession
of dizzy precipices. To a man brought up
on Alpine classics, there are few things more
disappointing than the ease of his first big
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
peak. The rock work on the average Oberland
or Zermat peaks by the ordinary route
is simple, straightforward scrambling up
slopes whose average inclination is nearer
thirty than sixty degrees. It is the sort of
thing that the ordinary man can do by the
light of Nature. Rock-climbing, in the sense
in which the Dolomite or lake climber uses the
term, is an art which calls for high qualities of
nerve and physique. Such rock climbing was
almost unknown till some time after the close
of this period. No modern cragsman would
consider the Matterhorn, even if robbed of its
fixed ropes, as anything but a straightforward
piece of interesting rock work, unless he was
unlucky enough to find it in bad condition.
All this we may frankly admit. Mountaineering
as an art was only in its infancy when
the Matterhorn was climbed. And yet the
Englishmen whom we have mentioned in
this chapter did more for mountaineering
than any of their successors or predecessors.
Bourrit, De Saussure, Beck, Placidus à
Spescha, and the other pioneers of the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth century,
deserve the greatest credit. But their spirited
example gave no general impetus to the
sport. They were single-handed mountaineers;
and somehow they never managed to
fire the world with their own enthusiasm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
The Englishmen arrived late on the scene.
The great giants of more than one district
had been climbed. And yet mountaineering
was still the pursuit of a few isolated men
who knew little or nothing of their brother
climbers, who came and struggled and passed
away uncheered by the inspiring freemasonry
of a band of workers aiming at the same end.
It was left to the English to transform
mountaineering into a popular sport. Judged
even by modern standards some of these men
were fine mountaineers, none the less independent
because the fashion of the day
decreed that guides should be taken on difficult
expeditions. But even those who owed the
greater part of their success to their guides
were inspired by the same enthusiasm which,
unlike the lonely watchfires of the earlier
pioneers, kindled a general conflagration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="large">THE STORY OF THE MATTERHORN</span></h2>

<p>The history of mountaineering contains
nothing more dramatic than the epic of the
Matterhorn. There is no mountain which
appeals so readily to the imagination. Its
unique form has drawn poetic rhapsodies from
the most prosaic. “Men,” says Mr. Whymper,
“who ordinarily spoke or wrote like rational
beings when they came under its power seemed
to quit their senses, and ranted, and rhapsodied,
losing for a time all common forms of
speech. Even the sober De Saussure was
moved to enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>If the Matterhorn could thus inspire men
before the most famous siege in Alpine
history had clothed its cliffs in romance,
how much more must it move those for whom
the final tragedy has become historical?
The first view of the Matterhorn, and the
moment when the last step is taken on to
the final crest, are two moments which the
mountaineer never forgets. Those who knew
the old Zermat are unpleasantly fond of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
reminding us that the railway train and the
monster hôtels have robbed Zermat of its
charm; while the fixed ropes and sardine tins&mdash;[Those
dear old sardine tins! Our Alpine
writers would run short of satire if they could
not invoke their aid]&mdash;have finally humiliated
the unvanquished Titan. It may be so; but
it is easy enough to recover the old atmosphere.
You have only to visit Zermat in winter
when the train is not running. A long trudge
up twenty miles of shadowed, frosty valley,
a little bluff near Randa, and the Matterhorn
soars once more into a stainless sky. There
are no clouds, and probably not another
stranger in the valley. The hôtels are closed,
the sardine tins are buried, and the Matterhorn
renews like the immortals an undying youth.</p>

<p>The great mountain remained unconquered
mainly because it inspired in the hearts of
the bravest guides a despairing belief in its
inaccessibility. “There seemed,” writes Mr.
Whymper, “to be a cordon drawn round it
up to which one might go, but no further.
Within that line gins and efreets were supposed
to exist&mdash;the wandering Jew and the
spirits of the damned. The superstitious
natives in the surrounding valleys (many of
whom firmly believed it to be not only the

<p>Those who have a sense for the dramatic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
unities will feel that, for once in a way, Life
lived up to the conventions of Art, and
that even a great dramatist could scarcely
have bettered the materials afforded by the
history of the Matterhorn. As the story
unfolds itself one can scarcely help attributing
some fatal personality to the inanimate cliffs.
In the Italian valley of Breuil, the Becca, as
the Matterhorn used to be called, was for
centuries the embodiment of supernatural
terror. Mothers would frighten their children
by threats that the wild man of the Becca
would carry them away. And if the children
asked how the Matterhorn was born, they
would reply that in bygone years there dwelt
a giant in Aosta named Gargantua, who was
once seized with a longing for the country
beyond the range of peaks that divide Italy
from Switzerland. Now, in those far off
times, the mountains of the great barrier
formed one uniform ridge instead of (as now) a
series of peaks. The giant strode over this
range with one step. As he stood with one
foot in Switzerland and the other in Italy, the
surrounding rocks fell away, and the pyramid
of cliffs caught between his legs alone remained.
And thus was the Matterhorn formed. There
were many such legends; the reader may find
them in Whymper and Guido Rey. They
were enough to daunt all but the boldest.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p></div>

<p>The drama of the Matterhorn opens appropriately
enough with the three men who first
showed a contempt for the superstitions
that surrounded the Becca. The story of
that first attempt is told in Guido Rey’s
excellent monograph on the Matterhorn, a
monograph which has been translated by
Mr. Eaton into English as spirited as the
original Italian. This opening bout with the
Becca took place in 1858. Three natives
of Breuil, the little Italian valley at the foot
of the Matterhorn, met before dawn at the
châlet of Avouil. Of these, Jean Jacques
Carrel was in command. He was a mighty
hunter, and a fine mountaineer. The second,
Jean Antoine Carrel, “il Bersaglier,” was
destined to play a leading part in the conflict
that was to close seven years later. Jean
Antoine was something more than a great
guide. He was a ragged, independent mountaineer,
difficult to control, a great leader, but
a poor follower. He was an old soldier, and
had fought at Novara. The third of these
young climbers was Aimé Gorret, a young boy
of twenty destined for the Church. His
solitary rambles among the hills had filled
him with a passionate worship of the
Matterhorn.</p>

<p>Without proper provisions or gear, these
three light-hearted knights set forth gaily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
on their quest. They mistook the way; and,
reaching a spot that pleased them, they
wasted hours in hurling rocks down a cliff&mdash;a
fascinating pursuit. When they reached
the point now known as the Tête du Lion
(12,215 feet) they contemplated the Matterhorn
which rose definitely beyond an intervening
gap. They looked at their great foe with
quiet assurance. The Becca would not run
away. Nobody else was likely to try a throw
with the local giant. One day they would
come back and settle the issue. There was
no immediate hurry.</p>

<p>In 1860 a daring attempt was made by
Messrs. Alfred, Charles, and Sanbach Parker
of Liverpool. These bold climbers dispensed
with guides, and had the wisdom to attack
the east face that rises above Zermat. All
the other early explorers attacked the Italian
ridge; and, as will be seen, the first serious
assault on the eastern face succeeded. Lack
of time prevented the Parkers from reaching
a greater height than 12,000 feet; nor were
they more successful in the following year,
but they had made a gallant attempt, for
which they deserve credit. In 1860 another
party had assailed the mountain from Italy,
and reached a height of about 13,000 feet.
The party consisted of Vaughan Hawkins
and Prof. Tyndall, whom he had invited to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
join the party, with the guides J. J. Carrel
and Bennen.</p>

<p>In 1861 Edward Whymper, who had opened
his Alpine career in the previous year, returned
to the Alps determined to conquer two virgin
summits of the Alps, the Matterhorn and the
Weishorn. On arriving at Chatillon, he
learned that the Weishorn had been climbed
by Tyndall, and that Tyndall was at Breuil
intending to add the Matterhorn to his conquests.
Whymper determined to anticipate
him. He arrived at Breuil on August 28, with
an Oberland guide, and inquired for the
best man in the valley. The knowing ones
with a voice recommended Jean Antoine
Carrel, a member of the first party to set
foot on the Matterhorn. “We sought, of
course, for Carrel, and found him a well-made,
resolute looking fellow, with a certain defiant
air which was rather taking. Yes, he would
go. Twenty francs a day, whatever the
result, was his price. I assented. But I
must take his comrade. As he said this,
an evil countenance came forth out of the
darkness, and proclaimed itself the comrade.
I demurred, and negotiations were broken
off.”</p>

<p>At Breuil, they tried to get another man
to accompany them but without success.
The men they approached either would not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
go or asked a prohibitive price. “This, it
may be said once and for all, was the reason
why so many futile attempts were made on
the Matterhorn. One guide after another
was brought up to the mountain and patted
on the back, but all declined the business.
The men who went had no heart in the matter,
and took the first opportunity to turn back.
For they were, with the exception of the man
to whom reference will be made [J. A. Carrel]
universally impressed with the belief that
the summit was entirely inaccessible.”</p>

<p>Whymper and his guide bivouacked in a
cowshed; and as night approached they saw
J. A. Carrel and his companion stealing up
the hillside. Whymper asked them if they
had repented, and would join his party.
They replied that they had contemplated
an independent assault. “Oh, then, it is
not necessary to have more than three.”
“Not for us.” “I admired their pluck and
had a strong inclination to engage the pair,
but finally decided against it. The companion
turned out to be J. J. Carrel. Both were
bold mountaineers; but Jean Antoine was
incomparably the better of the two, and was
the finest rock climber I have ever seen.
He was the only man who persistently refused
to accept defeat, and who continued to believe,
in spite of all discouragements, that the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
mountain was not inaccessible, and that it
could be ascended from the side of his native
valley.”</p>

<p>Carrel was something more than a great
guide. He remained a soldier long after he
had laid down his sword. He was, above all,
an Italian, determined to climb the Matterhorn
by the great Italian ridge, to climb it for the
honour of Italy, and for the honour of his
native valley. The two great moments of
his life were those in which he heard the shouts
of victory at Colle di Santiarno, and the cries
of triumph on the summit of the Italian ridge.
Whymper, and later Tyndall, found him an
awkward man to deal with. He had the
rough, undisciplined nature of the mountain
he loved. He looked on the Matterhorn as
a kind of preserve, and was determined that
he and no other should lead on the final
and successful ascent. Whymper’s first
attempt failed owing to the poor qualities
of his guide; and the Carrels were not more
successful.</p>

<p>During the three years that followed,
Whymper made no less than six attempts
to climb the Matterhorn. On one occasion
he climbed alone and unaided higher than
any of his predecessors. Without guides
or companions, he reached a height of 13,500
feet. There is little to be said for solitary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
climbing, but this feat stands out as one
of the boldest achievements of the period.
The critics of solitary scrambling need, however,
look no further than its sequel for their
moral. In attempting to negotiate a corner
on the Tête du Lion, Whymper slipped and
fell. He shot down an ice slope, slid and
bounded through a vertical height of about
200 feet, and was eventually thrown against
the side of a gully where it narrowed. Another
ten feet would have taken him in one terrific
bound of 800 feet on to the glacier below.
The blood was pulsing out of numerous cuts.
He plastered up the wounds in his head with
a lump of snow before scrambling up into
a place of safety, where he promptly fainted
away. He managed, however, to reach Breuil
without further adventure. Within a week
he had returned to the attack.</p>

<p>He made two further attempts that year
which failed for various reasons; but he had
the satisfaction of seeing Tyndall fail when
success seemed assured. Tyndall had brought
with him the great Swiss guide Bennen, and a
Valaisian guide named Walter Anton. He
engaged Jean Antoine and Cæsar Carrel.
They proposed to attack the mountain by
the Italian ridge. Next morning, somebody
ran in to tell Whymper that a flag had been
seen on the summit. This proved a false
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
alarm. Whymper waited through the long
day to greet the party on their return. “I
could not bring myself to leave, but lingered
about as a foolish lover hovers round the
object of his affections even after he has been
rejected. The sun had set before the men
were discerned coming over the pastures.
There was no spring in their steps&mdash;they, too,
were defeated.”</p>

<p>Prof. Tyndall told Whymper that he had
arrived “within a stone’s-throw of the summit”&mdash;the
mountain is 14,800 feet high,
14,600 feet had been climbed. “He greatly
deceived himself,” said Whymper, “for the
point which he reached is no less than 800 feet
below the summit. The failure was due to
the fact that the Carrels had been engaged
in a subordinate capacity.” When they were
appealed to for their opinion, they replied:
“We are porters, ask your guides.” Carrel
always determined that the Matterhorn should
be climbed from Italy, and that the leader
of the climb should be an Italian. Bennen
was a Swiss and Carrel had been engaged as a
second guide. Tyndall and Whymper found
it necessary to champion their respective
guides, Carrel and Bennen; and a more or
less heated controversy was carried on in the
pages of <i>The Alpine Journal</i>.</p>

<p>The Matterhorn was left in peace till the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
next year, but, meanwhile, a conspiracy for
its downfall was hatched in Italy. The story
is told in Guido Rey’s classic book on the
Matterhorn, a book which should be read side
by side with Whymper’s <i>Scrambles</i>, as it gives
the Italian version of the final stages in which
Italy and England fought for the great prize.
In 1863, some leading Italian mountaineers
gathered together at Turin to found an Italian
Alpine Club. Amongst these were two well-known
scientists, Felice Giordano and Quintino
Sella. They vowed that, as English climbers
had robbed them of Monte Viso, prince of
Piedmontese peaks, Italy should have the
honour of conquering the Matterhorn, and
that Italians should climb it from Italy by
the Italian ridge. The task was offered to
Giordano, who accepted it.</p>

<p>In 1863 Whymper and Carrel made another
attempt on the Matterhorn, which was foiled
by bad weather. In the next year, the
mountain was left alone; but the plot for its
downfall began to mature. Giordano and
Sella had met Carrel, and had extracted from
him promises of support. Carrel was, above
all, an Italian, and, other things being equal,
he would naturally prefer to lead an Italian,
rather than an English, party to the summit.</p>

<p>And now we come to the closing scenes.
In 1865 Whymper returned to the attack,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
heartily tired of the Italian ridge. With
the great guides Michel Croz and Christian
Almer, Whymper attempted to reach the
summit by a rock couloir that starts from near
the Breuiljoch, and terminates high up on
the Furggen arête. This was a mad scheme;
and the route they chose was the most impracticable
of all the routes that had ever been
attempted on the Matterhorn. Even to-day,
the great couloir has not been climbed, and
the top half of the Furggen ridge has only
been once ascended (or rather outflanked on
the Italian side), an expedition of great danger
and difficulty. Foiled in this attempt,
Whymper turned his attention to the Swiss
face. The eastern face is a fraud. From
the Riffel and from Zermat, it appears almost
perpendicular; but when seen in profile from
the Zmutt glacier it presents a very different
appearance. The average angle of the slope
as far as “the shoulder,” about 13,925 feet,
is about thirty degrees. From here to the
summit the angle steepens considerably but
is never more than fifty degrees. The wonder
is that Whymper, who had studied the mountain
more than once from the Zmutt glacier,
still continued his attempts on the difficult
Italian ridge.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June 1865, Whymper arrived
in Breuil, and explained to Carrel his change
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
of plan. He engaged Carrel, and made plans
for his attack on the Swiss face, promising
Carrel that, if that failed, they should return
to the Italian ridge. Jean Antoine told
Whymper that he would not be able to serve
him after the 11th, as he was engaged to
travel “with a family of distinction in the
valley of Aosta.” Whymper asked him why
he had not told him this before; and he
replied that the engagement had been a long-standing
one, but that the actual day had not
been fixed. Whymper was annoyed; but
he could find no fault with the answer, and
parted on friendly terms with Carrel. But
the family of distinction was no other than
Giordano. “You are going to leave me,”
Whymper had said to Carrel, “to travel
with a party of ladies. The work is not fit
for you.” Carrel had smiled; and Whymper
had taken the smile as a recognition of the
implied compliment. Carrel smiled because
he knew that the work he had in hand was
more fitted for him than for any other man.</p>

<p>On the 7th, Giordano had written to Sella:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Let us, then, set out to attack this Devil’s
mountain; and let us see that we succeed,
if only Whymper has not been beforehand
with us.” On the 11th, he wrote again: “Dear
Quintino, It is high time for me to send you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
news from here. I reached Valtournanche
on Saturday at midday. There I found
Carrel, who had just returned from a reconnoitring
expedition on the Matterhorn, which
had proved a failure owing to bad weather.
Whymper had arrived two or three days
before; as usual, he wished to make the
ascent, and had engaged Carrel, who, not
having had my letters, had agreed, but for
a few days only. Fortunately, the weather
turned bad, Whymper was unable to make his
fresh attempt; and Carrel left him, and came
with me together with five other picked men
who are the best guides in the valley. We
immediately sent off our advance guard with
Carrel at its head. In order not to excite
remark, we took the rope and other materials
to Avouil, a hamlet which is very remote and
close to the Matterhorn; and this is to be
our lower base.... I have tried to keep
everything secret; but that fellow, whose
life seems to depend on the Matterhorn, is
here suspiciously prying into everything. I
have taken all the competent men away from
him; and yet he is so enamoured of the
mountain that he may go with others and
make a scene. He is here in this hôtel, and
I try to avoid speaking to him.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Whymper discovered on the 10th the identity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
of the “family of distinction.” He was
furious. He considered, with some show of
justification, that he had been “bamboozled
and humbugged.”</p>

<p>The Italian party had already started for
the Matterhorn, with a large store of provisions.
They were an advance party designed
to find and facilitate the way. They
would take their time. Whymper took
courage. On the 11th, a party arrived from
Zermat across the Théodule. One of these
proved to be Lord Francis Douglas, who,
a few days previously, had made the second
ascent of the Gabelhorn, and the first from
Zinal. Lord Francis was a young and ambitious
climber; and he was only too glad
to join Whymper in an attack on the Swiss
face of the Matterhorn. They crossed to
Zermat together on the 12th, and there discovered
Mr. Hudson, a great mountaineer,
accompanied by the famous guide Michel
Croz, who had arrived at Zermat with the
Matterhorn in view. They agreed to join
forces; and Hudson’s friend Hadow was
admitted to the party. Hadow was a young
man of nineteen who had just left Harrow.
Whymper seemed doubtful of his ability;
but Hudson reassured him by remarking
that Mr. Hadow had done Mont Blanc in
less time than most men. Peter Taugwalder,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Lord Francis’s guide, and Peter’s two sons
completed the party. On the 13th of July
they left Zermat.</p>

<p>On the 14th of July Giordano wrote a short
letter every line of which is alive with grave
triumph. “At 2 p.m. to-day I saw Carrel
&amp; Co., on the top of the Matterhorn.” Poor
Giordano! The morrow was to bring a sad
disappointment; and his letter dated the
15th of July contains a pregnant sentence:
“Although every man did his duty, it is a
lost battle, and I am in great grief.”</p>

<p>This is what had happened. Whymper
and his companions had left Zermat on the
13th at half-past five. The day was cloudless.
They mounted leisurely, and arrived
at the base of the actual peak about half-past
eleven. Once fairly on the great eastern face,
they were astonished to find that places which
looked entirely impracticable from the Riffel
“were so easy that they could run about.”
By mid-day they had found a suitable place
for the tent at a height of about 11,000
feet. Croz and young Peter Taugwalder
went on to explore. They returned at about
3 p.m. in a great state of excitement. There
was no difficulty. They could have gone to
the top that day and returned.... “Long
after dusk, the cliffs above echoed with our
laughter, and with the songs of the guides,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
for we were happy that night in camp, and
feared no evil.”</p>

<p>Whymper’s story is told with simplicity
and restraint. He was too good a craftsman
to spoil a great subject by unnecessary strokes.
They started next day before dawn. They
had left Zermat on the 13th, and they left
their camp on a Friday (the superstitious
noted these facts when the whole disastrous
story was known). The whole of the great
eastern slope “was now revealed, rising for
3000 feet like a huge natural staircase. Some
parts were more and others were less easy;
but we were not once brought to a halt by
any serious impediment.... For the greater
part of the way there was no need for the
rope, and sometimes Hudson led, and sometimes
myself.” When they arrived at the
snow ridge now known as “The Shoulder,”
which is some 500 feet below the summit,
they turned over on to the northern
face. This proved more difficult; but the
general angle of the slope was nowhere more
than forty degrees. Hadow’s want of experience
began to tell, and he required a certain
amount of assistance. “The solitary difficult
part was of no great extent.... A
long stride round a rather awkward corner
brought us to snow once more. The last
doubt had vanished. The Matterhorn was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
ours. Nothing but 200 feet of easy snow
remained to be surmounted.”</p>

<p>But they were not yet certain that they
had not been beaten. The Italians had left
Breuil four days before. All through the
climb, false alarms had been raised of men
on the top. The excitement became intense.
“The slope eased off; at length we could be
detached; and Croz and I, dashing away,
ran a neck-and-neck race which ended in a
dead heat. At 1.40 p.m. the world was at
our feet, and the Matterhorn was conquered.”</p>

<p>No footsteps could be seen; but the summit
of the Matterhorn consists of a rudely level
ridge about 350 feet in length, and the Italians
might have been at the further end. Whymper
hastened to the Italian summit, and again
found the snow untrodden. They peered over
the ridge, and far below on the right caught
sight of the Italian party. “Up went my
arms and hat. ‘Croz, Croz, come here!’
‘Where are they, monsieur?’ ‘There, don’t
you see them, down there.’ ‘Ah, the coquins,
they are low down.’ ‘Croz, we must make
those fellows hear us.’ They yelled until
they were hoarse. ‘Croz, we must make
them hear us, they shall hear us.’” Whymper
seized a block of rock and hurled it down,
and called on his companion to do the same.
They drove their sticks in, and soon a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
whole torrent was pouring down. “There
was no mistake about it this time. The
Italians turned and fled.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Croz planted a tent-pole which they had
taken with them, though Whymper protested
that it was tempting Providence, and fixed
his blouse to it. A poor flag&mdash;but it was
seen everywhere. At Breuil&mdash;as we have
seen&mdash;they cheered the Italian victory. But
on the morrow the explorers returned down-hearted.
“The old legends are true&mdash;there
are spirits on the top of the Matterhorn. We
saw them ourselves&mdash;they hurled stones at
us.”</p>

<p>We may allow this dramatic touch to pass
unchallenged, though, whatever Carrel may
have said to his friends, he made it quite
clear to Giordano that he had identified the
turbulent spirits, for, in the letter from which
we have quoted, Giordano tells his friends
that Carrel had seen Whymper on the summit.
It might, perhaps, be worth while to add that
the stones Whymper hurled down the ridge
could by no possible chance have hit Carrel’s
party. “Still, I would,” writes Whymper,
“that the leader of that party could have
stood with us at that moment, for our victorious
shouts conveyed to him the disappointment
of a lifetime. He was <i>the</i> man of all
those who attempted the ascent of the Matterhorn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
who most deserved to be first upon its
summit. He was the first to doubt its inaccessibility;
and he was the only man who
persisted in believing that its ascent would be
accomplished. It was the aim of his life
to make the ascent from the side of Italy,
for the honour of his native valley. For a
time, he had the game in his hands; he played
it as he thought best; but he made a false
move, and he lost it.”</p>

<p>After an hour on the summit, they prepared
to descend. The order of descent was curious.
Croz, as the best man in the party, should have
been placed last. As a matter of history, he
led, followed, in this order, by Hadow, Hudson,
Douglas, and Peter Taugwalder. Whymper
was sketching while the party was being
arranged. They were waiting for him to
tie on when somebody suggested that the
names had not been left in a bottle. While
Whymper put this right, the rest of the party
moved on. A few minutes later Whymper
tied on to young Peter, and followed detached
from the others. Later, Douglas asked
Whymper to attach himself to old Taugwalder,
as he feared that Taugwalder would not be
able to hold his ground in the event of a slip.
About three o’clock in the afternoon, Michel
Croz, who had laid aside his axe, faced the rock,
and, in order to give Hadow greater security,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
was putting his feet one by one into their
proper position. Croz then turned round to
advance another step when Hadow slipped,
fell against Croz, and knocked him over. “I
heard one startled exclamation from Croz,
and then saw him and Mr. Hadow flying downwards;
in another moment Hudson was
dragged from his steps, and Lord Francis
Douglas immediately after him. All this
was the work of a moment. Immediately
we heard Croz’s exclamation, old Peter and I
planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would
permit: the rope was taut between us, and
the jerk came on us both as on one man.
We held: but the rope broke midway between
Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. For
a few seconds, we saw our unfortunate companions
sliding downwards on their backs,
and spreading out their hands endeavouring
to save themselves. They passed from our
sight uninjured, disappeared one by one,
and then fell from precipice to precipice on
to the Matterhorngletscher below, a distance
of nearly 4000 feet in height. From the
moment the rope broke, it was impossible
to help them.”</p>

<p>For half-an-hour, Whymper and the two
Taugwalders remained on the spot without
moving. The two guides cried like children.
Whymper was fixed between the older and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
younger Taugwalder, and must have heartily
regretted that he left young Peter the responsibility
of last man down, for the young man was
paralysed with terror, and refused to move.
At last, he descended, and they stood together.
Whymper asked immediately for the end of
the rope that had given way, and noticed
with horror that it was the weakest of the
three ropes. It had never been intended to
use it save as a reserve in case much rope had
to be left behind to attach to the rocks.</p>

<p>For more than two hours after the fall,
Whymper expected that the Taugwalders
would fall. They were utterly unnerved. At
6 p.m. they arrived again on the snow
shoulder. “We frequently looked, but in
vain, for traces of our unfortunate companions;
we bent over the ridge and cried to them,
but no sound returned. Convinced at last
that they were neither within sight nor hearing,
we ceased from our useless efforts; and,
too cast down for speech, silently gathered
up our things, and the little effects of those
who were lost, preparatory to continuing the
descent.”</p>

<p>As they started down, the Taugwalders
raised the problem as to their payment,
Lord Francis being dead. “They filled,”
remarks Whymper, “the cup of bitterness
to overflowing, and I tore down the cliff
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
madly and recklessly in a way that caused
them more than once to inquire if I wished
to kill them.” The whole party spent the
night on a miserable ledge. Next day, they
descended in safety to Zermat. Seiler met
them at the door of his hôtel. “What is the
matter?” “The Taugwalders and I have
returned.” He did not need more, and burst
into tears, but lost no time in needless lamentations,
and set to work to rouse the village.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, Whymper set out with
the Rev. Canon M’Cormick to recover the
bodies of his friends. The local curé threatened
with excommunication any guide who
neglected Mass in order to attend the search
party. “To several, at least, this was a
severe trial. Peter Perrn declared, with
tears in his eyes, that nothing else would
have prevented him joining in the search.”
Guides from other valleys joined the party.
At 8.30 they got to the plateau at the top of
the glacier. They found Hudson, Croz and
Hadow, but “of Lord Francis Douglas nothing
was seen.”</p>

<p>This accident sent a thrill of horror through
the civilised world. The old file of <i>The Times</i>,
which is well worth consulting, bears tribute
to the profound sensation which the news of
this great tragedy aroused. Idle rumours of
every kind were afloat&mdash;with these we shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
deal later. For more than five weeks, not
a day passed without some letter or comment
in the columns of the leading English paper.
These letters, for the most part, embodied
the profound distrust with which the new sport
was regarded by the bulk of Englishmen.
If Lord Francis Douglas had been killed while
galloping after a fox, he would have been
considered to have fallen in action. That he
should have fallen on the day that the Matterhorn
fell, that he should have paid the supreme
forfeit for a triumphant hour in Alpine history&mdash;such
a death was obviously wholly without its
redeeming features. “It was the blue ribbon
of the Alps,” wrote <i>The Times</i>, “that poor
Lord Francis Douglas was trying for the other
day. If it must be so, at all events the Alpine
Club that has proclaimed this crusade must
manage the thing rather better, or it will
soon be voted a nuisance. If the work is
to be done, it must be done well. They must
advise youngsters to practise, and make sure
of their strength and endurance.”</p>

<p>For three weeks, Whymper gave no sign.
At last, in response to a dignified appeal from
Mr. Justice Wills, then President of the
Alpine Club, he broke silence, and gave to the
public a restrained account of the tragedy.
As we have said, malicious rumour had been
busy, and in ignorant quarters there had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
rumours of foul play. The Matterhorn accident
first popularised the theory that Alpine
ropes existed to be cut. Till then, the public
had supposed that the rope was used to
prevent cowardly climbers deserting their
party in an emergency. But from 1865
onwards, popular authors discovered a new
use for the rope. They divided all Alpine
travellers into two classes, those who cut the
rope from below (“Greater love hath no
man&mdash;a romance of the mountains”) and
those who cut the rope from above (“The
Coward&mdash;a tale of the snows”). A casual
reader might be pardoned for supposing that
the Swiss did a brisk business in sheath knives.
We should be the last to discourage this enterprising
school&mdash;their works have afforded
much joy to the climbing fraternity; but
we offer them in all humility a few remarks
on the art of rope-cutting by a member
of Class II (those who cut the rope from
above).</p>

<p>A knife could only be used with advantage
when a snowbridge gives way. It is easy
enough to hold a man who has fallen into a
crevasse; but it is often impossible to pull
him out. The whole situation is altered
on a rock face. If a man falls, a sudden
jerk may pull the rest of the party off the
face of the mountain. This will almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
certainly happen if the leader or, on a descent,
the last man down, falls, unless the rope is
anchored round a knob of rock, in which
case&mdash;provided the rope does not break&mdash;the
leader may escape with a severe shaking,
though a clear fall of more than fifteen feet
will usually break the rope if anchored; and,
if not anchored, the party will be dragged
off their holds one by one. Therefore, the
leader must not fall. If any other member
of the party falls, he should be held by the
man above. On difficult ground, only one
man moves at a time. No man moves until
the man above has secured himself in a
position where he can draw in the rope as the
man below advances. If he keeps it reasonably
taut, and is well placed, he should be
able to check any slip. A climber who slips
and is held by the rope can immediately get
new foothold and handhold. He is not in a
crevasse from which exit is impossible save
at the rope’s end. His slip is checked, and
he is swung up against a rock face. There is
no need to drag him up. The rest of the
party have passed over this face, and therefore
handholds and footholds can be found. The
man who has slipped will find fresh purchase,
and begin again. In the case of the Matterhorn
accident, the angle of the slope was about
forty degrees. There was an abundance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
hold, and if the rope had not parted Croz
and Hadow would have been abruptly checked,
and would have immediately secured themselves.
Now, if Taugwalder had cut the
rope, as suggested, he must have been little
short of an expert acrobat, and have cut it in
about the space of a second and a half <i>before
the jerk</i>. If he had waited for the jerk, either
he would have been dragged off, in which case
his knife would have come in handy, or he
would have held, in which case it would have
been unnecessary.</p>

<p>To mountaineers, all this, of course, is a
truism; and we should not have laboured
the point if we wrote exclusively for mountaineers.
Even so, Peter’s comrades at Zermat
(who should have known better) persisted
in believing that he cut the rope. “In regard
to this infamous charge,” writes Whymper,
“I say that he could not do so at the moment
of the slip, and that the end of the rope in
my possession shows that he did not do so
before.” Whymper, however, adds: “There
remains the suspicious fact that the rope
which broke was the thinnest and weakest one
we had. It is suspicious because it is unlikely
that the men in front would have selected
an old and weak rope when there was an
abundance of new, and much stronger, rope
to spare; and, on the other hand, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
if Taugwalder thought that an accident was
likely to happen, it was to his interest to have
the weaker rope placed where it was.”</p>

<p>One cannot help regretting that Whymper
lent weight to an unworthy suspicion. Taugwalder
was examined by a secret Court of
Inquiry; and Whymper prepared a set of
questions with a view to helping him to clear
himself. The answers, though promised, were
never sent; and Taugwalder ultimately left
the valley for America, returning only to die.
Whymper, in his classic book, suggested the
possibility of criminal dealings by publishing
photographs of the three ropes showing that
the rope broken was far the weakest.</p>

<p>Let us review the whole story as Whymper
himself tells it. We know that Whymper
crossed the Théodule on the eleventh in a
state of anger and despair. The prize for
which he had striven so long seemed to be
sliding from his grasp. Carrel had deserted
him just as the true line of attack had been
discovered. Like all mountaineers, he was
human. He gets together the best party he
can, and sets out with all haste determined to
win by a head. Hadow, a young man with
very little experience, is taken, and Hadow,
the weak link, is destined to turn triumph
into disaster. Let the mountaineer who has
never invited a man unfit for a big climb throw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the first stone. And, before he has thrown
it, let him remember the peculiar provocation
in Whymper’s case.</p>

<p>All goes well. The Matterhorn is conquered
with surprising ease. These six men
achieve the greatest triumph in Alpine history
without serious check. To Whymper, this
hour on the summit must have marked the
supreme climax of life, an hour that set its
seal on the dogged labours of past years.
Do men in such moments anticipate disaster?
Taugwalder might possibly have failed in a
sudden crisis; but is it likely that he should
deliberately prepare for an accident by carefully
planned treachery?</p>

<p>Now read the story as Whymper tells it.
The party are just about to commence the
descent. The first five hundred feet would
still be considered as demanding the greatest
care. The top five hundred feet of the Matterhorn,
but for the ropes with which the whole
mountain is now festooned, would always be a
difficult, if not a dangerous, section. Croz
was the best guide in the party. He should
have remained behind as sheet anchor.
Instead of this, he goes first. Whymper falls
out of line, to inscribe the names of the party,
ties himself casually on to young Peter, and
then “runs down after the others.” In the
final arrangements, young Peter, who was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
a young and inexperienced guide, was given
the vital position of last man down. Flushed
with triumph, their minds could find no room
for a doubt. Everything had gone through
with miraculous ease. Such luck simply
could not turn. It is in precisely such moments
as these that the mountains settle their score.
Mountaineering is a ruthless sport that demands
unremitting attention. In games, a moment’s
carelessness may lose a match, or a championship;
but in climbing a mistake may mean
death.</p>

<p>As for Taugwalder, one is tempted to
acquit him without hesitation; but there is
one curious story about Taugwalder which
gives one pause. The story was told to the
present writer by an old member of the
Alpine Club, and the following is an extract
from a letter: “I had rather you said ‘a
friend of yours’ without mentioning my
name. I had a good many expeditions with
old Peter Taugwalder, including Mont Blanc
and Monte Rosa; and I had rather a tender
spot for the somewhat coarse, dirty old beggar.
I should not like my name to appear to help
the balance to incline in the direction of his
guilt in that Matterhorn affair. It was not
on the Dent Blanche that he took the rope
off; it was coming down a long steep slope
of bare rock from the top of the Tête Blanche
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
towards Prayagé. I had a couple of men
with me who were inexperienced; and I fancy
he must have thought that, if one of them let
go, which was not unlikely, he would be able
to choose whether to hold on or let go. I
happened to look up and see what was going
on, and I made him tie up at once. I don’t
quite remember whether Whymper tells us
how far from Peter’s fingers the break in
the rope occurred. That seems to me one of
the most critical points.”</p>

<p>There we may leave Taugwalder, and the
minor issues of this great tragedy. The
broader lessons are summed up by Mr.
Whymper in a memorable passage: “So
the traditional inaccessibility of the Matterhorn
was vanquished, and was replaced by
legends of a more real character. Others
will essay to scale its proud cliffs, but to
none will it be the mountain that it was to the
early explorers. Others may tread its summit
snows, but none will ever know the
feelings of those who first gazed upon its
marvellous panorama; and none, I trust,
will ever be compelled to tell of joy turned
into grief, and of laughter into mourning.
It proved to be a stubborn foe; it resisted
long and gave many a hard blow; it was
defeated at last with an ease that none could
have anticipated, but like a relentless enemy&mdash;conquered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
but not crushed&mdash;it took a terrible
vengeance.”</p>

<p>The last sentence has a peculiar significance.
A strange fatality seems to dog the steps of
those who seek untrodden paths to the crest
of the Matterhorn. Disaster does not always
follow with the dramatic swiftness of that
which marked the conquest of the eastern
face, yet, slowly but surely, the avenging
spirit of the Matterhorn fulfils itself.</p>

<p>On July 16, two days after the catastrophe,
J. A. Carrel set out to crown Whymper’s
victory by proving that the Italian ridge was
not unconquerable. He was accompanied by
Abbé Gorret, a plucky priest who had shared
with him that first careless attack on the
mountain. Bich and Meynet completed the
party. The Abbé and Meynet remained
behind not very far from the top, in order to
help Carrel and Bich on the return at a place
where a short descent onto a ledge was liable
to cause difficulty on the descent. This
ledge, known as Carrel’s corridor, is about
forty minutes from the summit. It needed
a man of Carrel’s determined courage to follow
its winding course. It is now avoided.</p>

<p>The rest of the climb presented no difficulty.
Carrel had conquered the Italian ridge. The
ambition of years was half fulfilled, only half,
for the Matterhorn itself had been climbed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
One cannot but regret that he had turned back
on the 14th. Whymper’s cries of triumph
had spelt for him the disappointment of a
lifetime. Yet a fine rôle was open to him.
Had he gone forward and crowned Whymper’s
victory by a triumph unmarred by disaster;
had the Matterhorn defied all assaults for
years, and then yielded on the same day to a
party from the Swiss side and Carrel’s men
from Italy, the most dramatic page in Alpine
history would have been complete. Thirty-five
years later, the Matterhorn settled the
long outstanding debt, and the man who had
first attacked the citadel died in a snowstorm
on the Italian ridge of the mountain which he
had been the first to assail, and the first to
conquer.</p>

<p>Carrel was in his sixty-second year when he
started out for his last climb. Bad weather
detained the party in the Italian hut, and
Signor Sinigaglia noticed that Carrel was far
from well. After two nights in the hut,
the provisions began to run out; and it was
decided to attempt the descent. The rocks
were in a terrible condition, and the storm
added to the difficulty. Carrel insisted on
leading, though he was far from well. He
knew every yard of his own beloved ridge.
If a man could pilot them through the storm
that man was Carrel. Quietly and methodically,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
he fought his way downward, yard by
yard, undaunted by the hurricane, husbanding
the last ounces of his strength. He would
not allow the other guides to relieve him till
the danger was past, and his responsibilities
were over. Then suddenly he collapsed, and
in a few minutes the gallant old warrior
fell backwards and died. A cross now marks
the spot where the old soldier died in action.</p>

<p>In life the leading guides of Breuil had often
resented Carrel’s unchallenged supremacy.
But death had obliterated the old jealousies.
Years afterwards, a casual climber stopped
before Carrel’s cross, and remarked to the
son of Carrel’s great rival, “So that is where
Carrel fell.” “Carrel did not fall,” came the
indignant answer, “Carrel died.”</p>

<p>Let us turn from Carrel to the conquerors of
another great ridge of the Matterhorn.</p>

<p>Of others concerned with attacks on the
Italian ridge, Tyndall, Bennen, and J. J.
Macquignaz, all came to premature ends.
Bennen was killed in an historic accident on
the Haut de Cry, and Macquignaz disappeared
on Mont Blanc. In 1879, two independent
parties on the same day made the first ascent
of the great northern ridge of the Matterhorn
known as the Zmutt arête. Mummery and
Penhall were the amateurs responsible for
these two independent assaults. “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
memory,” writes Mummery, “of two rollicking
parties, comprised of seven men, who on one
day in 1879 were climbing on the west face
of the Matterhorn passes with ghost-like
admonition before my mind, and bids me
remember that, of these seven, Mr. Penhall
was killed on the Wetterhorn, Ferdinand
Imseng on the Macugnaga side of Monte
Rosa, and Johan Petrus on the Frersnay Mont
Blanc.” Of the remaining four, Mummery
disappeared in the Himalayas in 1895, Louis
Zurbrucken was killed, Alexander Burgener
perished in an avalanche near the Bergli hut
in 1911. Mr. Baumann and Emil Rey, who
with Petrus followed in Mummery’s footsteps
three days later, both came to untimely ends:
Baumann disappeared in South Africa, and
Emil Rey was killed on the Dent de Géant.
The sole survivor of these two parties is the
well-known Augustin Gentinetta, one of the
ablest of the Zermat guides. Burgener and
Gentinetta guided Mummery on the above-mentioned
climb, while Penhall was accompanied
by Louis Zurbrucken. In recent
times, three great mountaineers who climbed
this ridge together died violent deaths within
the year. The superstitious should leave the
Zmutt arête alone.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="large">MODERN MOUNTAINEERING</span></h2>

<p>Alpine History is not easy to divide into
arbitrary periods; and yet the conquest of
the Matterhorn does in a certain sense define
a period. It closes what has been called
“the golden age of mountaineering.” Only
a few great peaks still remained unconquered.
In this chapter we shall try to sketch some
of the tendencies which differentiate modern
mountaineering from mountaineering in the
so-called “golden age.”</p>

<p>The most radical change has been the
growth of guideless climbing, which was, of
course, to be expected as men grew familiar
with the infinite variety of conditions that
are the essence of mountaineering. In a
previous chapter we have discussed the main
differences between guided and guideless
climbing. It does not follow that a man of
considerable mountaineering experience, who
habitually climbs with guides need entirely
relinquish the control of the expedition. Such
a man&mdash;there are not many&mdash;may, indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
take a guide as a reserve of strength, or as
a weight carrier. He may enjoy training up
a young and inexperienced guide, who has a
native talent for rock and ice, while lacking
experience and mountain craft. One occasionally
finds a guide who is a first-class
cragsman, but whose general knowledge of
mountain strategy is inferior to that of a
great amateur. In such a combination, the
latter will be the real general of the expedition,
even if the guide habitually leads on
difficult rock and does the step-cutting. On
the other hand a member of a guideless party
may be as dependent on the rest of the party
as another man on his guides. Moreover,
tracks, climbers, guides and modern maps
render the mental work of the leader, whether
amateur or professional, much less arduous
than in more primitive days.</p>

<p>But when we have made all possible allowance
for the above considerations, there still
remains a real and radical distinction between
those who rely on their own efforts and
those who follow a guide. The man who
leads even on one easy expedition obtains a
greater insight into the secrets of his craft
than many a guided climber with a long
list of first-class expeditions.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of the great guideless
climbs was the ascent of Mont Blanc by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
E. S. Kennedy, Charles Hudson (afterwards
killed on the first ascent of the Matterhorn),
Grenville and Christopher Smyth, E. J.
Stevenson and Charles Ainslie. Their climb
was made in 1855, and was the first complete
ascent of Mont Blanc from St. Gervais,
though the route was not new except in
combination, as every portion of it had been
previously done on different occasions. One
of the first systematic guideless climbers to
attract attention was the Rev. A. G. Girdlestone,
whose book, <i>The High Alps without
Guides</i>, appeared in 1870. This book was
the subject of a discussion at a meeting of
the Alpine Club. Mr. Grove, a well-known
mountaineer, read a paper on the comparative
skill of travellers and guides, and used
Girdlestone’s book as a text. Mr. Grove said:
“The net result of mountaineering without
guides appears to be this, that, in twenty-one
expeditions selected out of seventy for the
purposes of description, the traveller failed
absolutely four times; was in great danger
three times; was aided in finding the way
back by the tracks of other men’s guides four
times; succeeded absolutely without aid of
any kind ten times on expeditions, four of
which were very easy, three of moderate
difficulty, and one very difficult.” The “very
difficult” expedition is the Wetterhorn, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
is nowadays considered a very modest
achievement.</p>

<p>Mr. Girdlestone was a pioneer, with the
limitations of a pioneer. His achievements
judged by modern standards are modest
enough, but he was the first to insist that
mountaineering without guides is an art, and
that mountaineering with guides is often only
another form of conducted travel. The discussion
that followed, as might be expected,
at that time was not favourable either to
Girdlestone or to guideless climbing. Probably
each succeeding year will see his contribution
to modern mountaineering more
properly appreciated. The “settled opinion
of the Alpine Club” was declared without
a single dissentient to be that “the neglect
to take guides on difficult expeditions is
totally unjustifiable.”</p>

<p>But guideless climbing had come to stay.
A year after this memorable meeting of the
Alpine Club, two of its members carried out
without guides some expeditions more severe
than anything Girdlestone had attempted.
In 1871 Mr. John Stogdon, a well-known
Harrow master, and the Rev. Arthur Fairbanks
ascended the Nesthorn and Aletschhorn,
and in the following year climbed the Jungfrau
and Aletschhorn unguided. No record of these
expeditions found its way into print. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
1876, a party of amateurs, Messrs. Cust,
Cawood, and Colgrove climbed the Matterhorn
without guides. This expedition attracted
great attention, and was severely commented
on in the columns of the <i>Press</i>. Mr. Cust, in
an eloquent paper read before the Alpine
Club, went to the root of the whole matter
when he remarked: “Cricket is a sport which
is admitted by all to need acquired skill. A
man can buy his mountaineering as he can
buy his yachting. None the less, there are
yachtsmen and yachtsmen.”</p>

<p>Systematic climbing on a modern scale
without guides was perhaps first practised
by Purtscheller and Zsigmondys in 1880.
Among our own people, it found brilliant
exponents in Morse, Mummery, Wicks, and
Wilson some twenty years ago; and it has
since been adopted by many of our own
leading mountaineers. Abroad, guideless
climbing finds more adherents than with us.
Naturally enough, the man who lives near the
mountains will find it easier to make up a
guideless party among his friends; and, if he
is in the habit of spending all his holidays
and most of his week-ends among the mountains
that can be reached in a few hours from
his home, he will soon acquire the necessary
skill to dispense with guides.</p>

<p>So much for guideless climbing. Let us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
now consider some of the other important
developments in the practice of mountaineering.
In the Alps the tendency has been
towards specialisation. Before 1865 the ambitious
mountaineer had scores of unconquered
peaks to attack. After the defeat of the
Matterhorn, the number of the unclimbed
greater mountains gradually thinned out. The
Meije, which fell in 1877, was one of the last
great Alpine peaks to remain unclimbed.
With the development of rock-climbing, even
the last and apparently most hopelessly
inaccessible rock pinnacles of the Dolomites
and Chamounix were defeated. There is no
rock-climbing as understood in Wales or
Lakeland or Skye on giants of the Oberland
or Valais, such as the Schreckhorn or Matterhorn.
These tax the leader’s power of choosing
a route, his endurance and his knowledge of
snow and ice, and weather; but their demands
on the pure cragsman are less. The difficulty
of a big mountain often depends very much
on its condition and length. Up to 1865
hardly any expeditions had been carried
through&mdash;with a few exceptions, such as the
Brenva route up Mont Blanc&mdash;that a modern
expert would consider exceptionally severe.
Modern rock-climbing begins in the late
’seventies. The expeditions in the Dolomites
by men like Zsigmondy, Schmitt, and Winkler,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
among foreign mountaineers, belong to much
the same period as Burgener and Mummery
classic climbs in the Chamounix district.</p>

<p>Mummery is, perhaps, best known in connection
with the first ascent of the Grepon
by the sensational “Mummery crack,” when
his leader was the famous Alexander Burgener
aided by a young cragsman, B. Venetz.
Venetz, as a matter of fact, led up the “Mummery”
crack. Mummery’s vigorous book,
which has become a classic, contains accounts
of many new expeditions, such as the Grepon,
the Requin, the Matterhorn by the Zmutt
arête, and the Caucasian giant Dych Tau,
to name the more important. His book,
<i>My Climbs in the Alps and Caucasus</i>, is
thoroughly typical of the modern view of
mountaineering. It contains some doctrines
that are still considered heretical, such as the
safety of a party of two on a snow-covered
glacier, and many doctrines that are now
accepted, such as the justification of guideless
climbing and of difficult variation routes.
Shortly after the book appeared, Mummery
was killed on Nanga Parbat, as was Emil
Zsigmondy on the Meije soon after the issue
of his book on the dangers of the Alps.</p>

<p>But even Dolomites and Chamounix aiguilles
are not inexhaustible, and the number of
unconquered summits gradually diminished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
The rapid opening up of the Alps has naturally
turned the attention of men with the exploring
instinct and ample means to the exploration
of the great mountain ranges beyond Europe.
This does not fall within the scope of the
present volume, and we need only remark in
passing that British climbers have played an
important part in the campaigns against the
fortresses of the Himalaya, Caucasus, Andes,
and Rockies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ambitious mountaineer was
forced to look for new routes on old peaks.
Now, a man in search of the easiest way
up a difficult peak could usually discover
a route which was climbable without severe
technical difficulty. On a big mountain,
it is often possible to evade any small and
very difficult section. But most mountains,
even our British hills, have at least one
route which borders on the impossible, and
a diligent search will soon reveal it. Consider
the two extremes of rock-climbing. Let us
take the Matterhorn as a good example of a
big mountain which consists almost entirely
of rock. It is impossible to find a route up
the Matterhorn which one could climb with
one’s hands in one’s pockets, but the ordinary
Swiss route is an easy scramble as far as the
shoulder, and, with the fixed ropes, a straightforward
climb thence to the top. Its Furggen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Ridge has been once climbed under fair
conditions and then only with a partial
deviation. It is extremely severe and dangerous.
The task of the mountaineers who
first assailed the Matterhorn was to pick out
the easiest line of approach. The Zmutt,
and in a greater degree the Furggen routes,
were obviously ruled out of consideration.
The Italian route was tried many times
without success before the Swiss route was
discovered. Of course, the Matterhorn, like
all big mountains, varies in difficulty from
day to day. It is a very long climb; and, if
the conditions are unfavourable, it may prove
a very difficult and a very dangerous peak.</p>

<p>Turning to the nursery of Welsh climbers,
Lliwedd can be climbed on a mule, and
Lliwedd can also be climbed by about thirty
or more distinct routes up its southern rock
face. If a man begins to look for new routes
up a wall of a cliff a thousand feet in height
and a mile or so in breath, he will sooner or
later reach the line which divided reasonable
from unreasonable risk. Modern pioneer work
in the Alps is nearer the old ideal. It is not
simply the search for the hardest of all
climbable routes up a given rock face. In
England, the danger of a rock fall is practically
absent, and a rock face is not considered
climbed out as long as one can work up from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
base to summit by a series of ledges not
touched on a previous climb. Two such
routes will sometimes be separated by a few
feet. In the Alps, the pioneer is compelled
by objective difficulties to look for distinct
ridges and faces unswept by stones and
avalanches. There is a natural challenge in
the sweep of a great ridge falling through
some thousand unconquered feet to the
pastures below. There is only an artificial
challenge in a “new” route some thousand
feet in height separated only by a few yards
of cliff from an “old” route. We do not
wish to depreciate British climbing, which
has its own fascination and its own value;
but, if it calls for greater cragsmanship, it
demands infinitely less mountain craft than
the conquest of a difficult Alpine route.</p>

<p>And what is true of British rock-climbing
is even more true of Tirol. Ranges, such as
the Kaisergebirge, have been explored with
the same thoroughness that has characterised
British rock-climbing. Almost every conceivable
variation of the “just possible” has
been explored. Unfortunately, the death-roll
in these districts is painfully high, as the keenness
of the young Austrian and Bavarian has
not infrequently exceeded their experience
and powers.</p>

<p>Abroad, mountaineering has developed very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
rapidly since the ’sixties. We have seen that
English climbers, first in the field, secured
a large share of unconquered peaks; but
once continental climbers had taken up the
new sport, our earlier start was seriously
challenged. The Swiss, Austrian, and German
have one great advantage. They are much
nearer the Alps; and mountaineering in these
countries is, as a result, a thoroughly democratic
sport. The foreign Alpine Clubs number
thousands of members. The German-Austrian
Alpine Club has alone nearly ninety
thousand members. There is no qualification,
social or mountaineering. These great national
clubs have a small subscription; and
with the large funds at their disposal they
are able to build club-huts in the mountains,
and excellent meeting places in the great
towns, where members can find an Alpine
library, maps, and other sources of information.
They secure many useful concessions,
such as reduced fares for their members on
Alpine railways. Mountaineering naturally
becomes a democratic sport in mountainous
countries, because the mountains are accessible.
The very fact that a return ticket to
the Alps is a serious item must prevent
Alpine climbing from becoming the sport of
more than a few of our countrymen. At the
same time, we have an excellent native playground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
in Wales and Cumberland, which has
made it possible for young men to learn the
craft before they could afford a regular climbing
holiday in the Alps. Beside the great
national clubs of the Continent, there are a
number of vigorous university clubs scattered
through these countries. Of these, the Akademischer
Alpine clubs at Zürich and Munich
are, perhaps, the most famous. These clubs
consist of young men reading at the Polytechnic
or University. They have as high a
mountaineering qualification as any existing
Alpine clubs. They attach importance to
the capacity to lead a guideless party rather
than to the bare fact that a man has climbed
so many peaks. Each candidate is taken on
a series of climbs by members of the club,
who report to the committee on his general
knowledge of snow and rock conditions, and
his fitness, whether in respect of courage or
endurance for arduous work.</p>

<p>It is young men of this stamp that play
such a great part in raising the standard of
continental mountaineering. Their cragsmanship
often verges on the impossible. A
book published in Munich, entitled <i>Empor</i>,
affords stimulating reading. This book was
produced in honour and in memory of Georg
Winkler by some of his friends. Winkler was
a young Munich climber who carried through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
some of the most daring rock climbs ever
recorded. <i>Empor</i> contains his diary, and
several articles contributed by various members
of one of the most remarkable climbing
groups in Alpine history. Winkler’s amazing
performances give to the book a note which
is lacking in most Alpine literature. Winkler
was born in 1869. As a boy of eighteen he
made, quite alone, the first ascent of the
Winklerturm, one of the most sensational&mdash;both
in appearance and reality&mdash;of all Dolomite
pinnacles. On the 14th of August
1888 he traversed alone the Zinal Rothhorn,
and on the 18th he lost his life in a
solitary attempt on the great Zinal face of
the Weisshorn. No definite traces of him
have ever been found. His brother, born in
the year of his death, has also carried through
some sensational solitary climbs.</p>

<p>We may, perhaps, be excused a certain
satisfaction in the thought that the British
crags can occasionally produce climbers whose
achievements are quite as sensational as
those of the Winklers. Without native mountains,
we could not hope to produce cragsmen
equal to those of Tirol and the Alps. One
must begin young. It is, as a rule, only a
comparatively small minority that can afford
a regular summer holiday in the Alps; but
Scawfell and Lliwedd are accessible enough,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
and the comparatively high standard of the
British rock-climber owes more to British
than to Alpine mountains. It was only in
the last two decades that the possibilities of
these crags were systematically worked out,
though isolated climbs have been recorded
for many years. The patient and often brilliant
explorations of a group of distinguished
mountaineers have helped to popularise a fine
field for native talent, and an arena for those
who cannot afford a regular Alpine campaign.
Guides are unknown in Great Britain, and the
man who learns to climb there is often more
independent and more self-reliant than the
mountaineer who is piloted about by guides.
There is, of course, much that can be learned
only in the Alps. The home climber can
learn to use an axe in the wintry gullies round
Scawfell. He learns something of snow; but
both snow and ice can only be properly studied
in the regions of perpetual snow. The home-trained
cragsman, as a rule, learns to lead up
rocks far more difficult than anything met
with on the average Swiss peaks, but the
wider lessons of route-finding over a long and
complicated expedition are naturally not
acquired on a face of cliff a thousand feet in
height. Nor, for that matter, is the art of
rapid descent over easy rocks; for the British
climber usually ascends by rocks, and runs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
home over grass and scree. None the less,
these cliffs have produced some wonderfully
fine mountaineers. We have our Winklers,
and we have also young rock-climbers who
confine their energies to the permissible limit
of the justifiable climbing and who, within
those limits, carry their craft to its most
refined possibilities. Hugh Pope, one of the
most brilliant of the younger school of rock-climbers,
learned his craft on the British hills,
and showed in his first Alpine season the value
of that training. To the great loss of British
mountaineering he was killed in 1912 on the
Pic du Midi d’Ossau.</p>

<p>Another comparatively recent development
is the growth of winter mountaineering. The
first winter expedition of any importance
after the beginnings of serious mountaineering
was Mr. T. S. Kennedy’s attempt on the
Matterhorn in 1863. He conceived the curious
idea that the Matterhorn might prove easier
in winter than in summer. Here, he was very
much mistaken. He was attacked by a storm,
and retreated after reaching a point where
the real climb begins. It was a plucky expedition.
But the real pioneer of winter
mountaineering was W. A. Moore. In 1866,
with Mr. Horace Walker, Melchior Anderegg,
Christian Almer, and “Peterli” Bohren, he left
Grindelwald at midnight; they crossed the Finsteraarjoch,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
and returned within the twenty-four
hours to Grindelwald over the Strahlegg.
Even in summer this would prove a strenuous
day. In winter, it is almost incredible that
this double traverse should have been carried
through without sleeping out.</p>

<p>Most of the great peaks have now been
ascended in winter; and amongst others Mr.
Coolidge must be mentioned as a prominent
pioneer. His ascents of the Jungfrau, Wetterhorn,
and Schreckhorn&mdash;the first in winter&mdash;with
Christian Almer, did much to set the
fashion. Mrs. Le Blond, the famous lady
climber, has an even longer list of winter
first ascents to her credit. But the real
revolution in winter mountaineering has been
caused by the introduction of ski-ing. In
winter, the main difficulty is getting to the
high mountain huts. Above the huts, the
temperature is often mild and equable for
weeks together. A low temperature on the
ground co-exists with a high temperature in
the air. Rock-ridges facing south or south-west
are often denuded of snow, and as easy
to climb as in summer. Signor Sella also
made some brilliant winter ascents, such as
the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa.</p>

<p>The real obstacle to winter mountaineering
is the appalling weariness of wading up to
the club-huts on foot. The snow in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
sheltered lower valleys is often deep and
powdery; and the climber on foot will have
to force his way through pine forests where
the snow lies in great drifts between the trees,
and over moraines where treacherous drifts
conceal pitfalls between the loose stones. All
this is changed by the introduction of ski.
The ski distributes the weight of the climber
over a long, even surface; and in the softest
snow he will not sink in more than a few
inches. Better still, they revolutionise the
descent, converting a weary plug through
snow-drifts into a succession of swift and
glorious runs. The ski-runner takes his ski
to the foot of the last rock ridges, and then
proceeds on foot, rejoining his ski, and covering
on the descent five thousand feet in far less
time than the foot-climber would take over
five hundred. Skis, as everybody knows,
were invented as a means of crossing snowy
country inaccessible on foot. They are sometimes
alluded to as snowshoes, but differ
radically from snowshoes in one important
respect. Both ski and the Canadian snowshoe
distribute their wearer’s weight, and
enable him to cross drifts where he would
sink in hopelessly if he were on foot, but there
the resemblance ends. For, whereas snowshoes
cannot slide on snow, and whereas a
man on snowshoes cannot descend a hill as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
fast as a man on foot could run down hill,
skis glide rapidly and easily on snow, and a
ski-runner can descend at a rate which may
be anything up to sixty miles an hour.</p>

<p>Ski-ing is of Scandinavian origin, and the
greatest exponents of the art are the Norwegians.
Norwegians have used ski from
time immemorial in certain districts, such as
Telemarken, as a means of communication
between snow-bound villages. It should, perhaps,
be added that ski-jumping does not
consist, as some people imagine, in casual
leaps across chasms or over intervening
hillocks. The ski-runner does not glide along
the level at the speed of an express train,
lightly skimming any obstacles in his path.
On the level, the best performer does not go
more than six or seven miles an hour, and the
great jumps one hears of are made downhill.
The ski-runner swoops down on to a specially
prepared platform, leaps into the air, and
alights on a very steep slope below. The
longest jump on record is some hundred and
fifty feet, measured from the edge of the
take-off to the alighting point. In this case,
the ski-runner must have fallen through
nearly seventy vertical feet.</p>

<p>To the mountaineer, the real appeal of
ski-ing is due to the fact that it halves the
labour of his ascent to the upper snowfields,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
and converts a tedious descent into a succession
of swift and fascinating runs. The
ski-runner climbs on ski to the foot of the
final rock and ice ridges, and then finishes
the climb in the ordinary way. After rejoining
his ski, his work is over, and his
reward is all before him. If he were on foot,
he would have to wade laboriously down to
the valley. On ski, he can swoop down with
ten times the speed, and a thousand times
the enjoyment.</p>

<p>Ski were introduced into Central Europe
in the early ’nineties. Dr. Paulcke’s classic
traverse of the Oberland in 1895, which
included the ascent of the Jungfrau, proved
to mountaineers the possibilities of the new
craft. Abroad, the lesson was soon learned.
To-day, there are hundreds of ski-runners
who make a regular practice of mountaineering
in winter. The Alps have taken out a new
lease of life. In summer, the huts are
crowded, the fashionable peaks are festooned
with parties of incompetent novices who are
dragged and pushed upwards by their guides,
but in winter the true mountain lover has
the upper world to himself. The mere
summit hunter naturally chooses the line of
least resistance, and accumulates his list of
first class expeditions in the summer months,
when such a programme is easiest to compile.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
The winter mountaineer must be more or
less independent of the professional element,
for, though he will probably employ a guide
to find the way and to act as a reserve of
strength, he himself must at least be able to
ski steadily, and at a fair speed.</p>

<p>Moreover, mountain craft as the winter
mountaineer understands the term is a more
subtle and more embracing science as far, at
least, as snow conditions are concerned. It
begins at the hôtel door. In summer, there
is a mule path leading to the glacier line, a
mule path which a man can climb with his
mind asleep. But in winter the snow with
its manifold problems sweeps down to the
village. A man has been killed by an
avalanche within a few yards of a great
hôtel. From the moment a man buckles on
his ski, he must exercise his knowledge of
snow conditions. There are no paths save a
few woodcutter’s tracks. From the valley
upwards, he must learn to pick a good line,
and to avoid the innocent-looking slopes
that may at any moment resolve themselves
into an irresistible avalanche. Many a man is
piloted up a succession of great peaks without
acquiring anything like the same intimate
knowledge of snow that is possessed even
by a ski-runner who has never crossed the
summer snow-line. Even the humblest ski-runner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
must learn to diagnose the snow. He
may follow his leader unthinkingly on the
ascent; but once he starts down he must
judge for himself. If he makes a mistake,
he will be thrown violently on to his face
when the snow suddenly sticks, and on to
his back when it quickens. Even the most
unobservant man will learn something of the
effects of sun and wind on his running surface
when the result of a faulty deduction may
mean violent contact with Mother Earth.</p>

<p>Those who worship the Alps in their loveliest
and loneliest moods, those who dislike the
weary anti-climax of the descent through
burning snowfields, and down dusty mule
paths, will climb in the winter months,
when to the joy of renewing old memories of
the mountains in an unspoiled setting is added
the rapture of the finest motion known to
man.</p>

<p>In England mountaineering on ski has yet
to find many adherents. We have little
opportunity for learning to ski in these isles,
and the ten thousand Englishmen that visit
the Alps in winter prefer to ski on the lower
hills. For every Englishman with a respectable
list of glacier tours on ski to his credit,
there are at least a hundred continental runners
with a record many times more brilliant.
The Alpine Ski Club, now in its sixth year,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
has done much to encourage this “new mountaineering,”
and its journal contains a record
of the finest expeditions by English and
continental runners. But even in the pages
of the Alpine Ski Club Annual, the proportion
of foreign articles describing really fine tours
is depressingly large. Of course, the continental
runner lives nearer the Alps. So did
the continental mountaineer of the early
’sixties; but that did not prevent us taking
our fair share of virgin peaks.</p>

<p>The few Englishmen who are making a
more or less regular habit of serious mountaineering
on ski are not among the veterans
of summer mountaineering, and the leaders
of summer mountaineering have not yet
learned to ski. Abroad, the leaders of summer
mountaineering have welcomed ski-ing as a
key to their mountains in winter; but the
many leaders of English mountaineering still
argue that skis should not be used in the
High Alps, on the ground that they afford
facility for venturing on slopes and into
places where the risk of avalanches is extreme.
On the Continent thousands of
runners demonstrate in the most effective
manner that mountaineering on ski has come
to stay. It is consoling to reflect that
English ski-runners are prepared to work out
the peculiar problems of their craft with or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
without the help of summer mountaineers.
Of course, both ski-ing and summer mountaineering
would be strengthened by an
alliance, and ski-runners can best learn the
rules of the glacier world in winter from those
mountaineers who combine a knowledge of
the summer Alps with some experience of
winter conditions and a mastery of ski-ing.
For the moment, such teachers must be looked
for in the ranks of continental mountaineers.

<span class="large">THE ALPS IN LITERATURE</span></h2>

<p>The last chapter has brought the story of
mountaineering up to modern times, but,
before we close, there is another side of Alpine
exploration on which we must touch. For
Alpine exploration means something more
than the discovery of new passes and the
conquest of virgin peaks. That is the physical
aspect of the sport, perhaps the side which the
average climber best understands. But Alpine
exploration is mental as well as physical, and
concerns itself with the adventures of the
mind in touch with the mountains as well as
with the adventures of the body in contact
with an unclimbed cliff. The story of the
gradual discovery of high places as sources of
inspiration has its place in the history of
Alpine exploration, as well as the record of
variation routes too often expressed in language
of unvarying monotony.</p>

<p>The present writer once undertook to compile
an anthology whose scope was defined
by the title&mdash;<i>The Englishman in the Alps</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
The limitations imposed by the series of which
this anthology formed a part prevented him
from including the Alpine literature of foreign
authors, a fact which tended to obscure the
real development of the Alpine literature. In
the introduction he expressed the orthodox
views which all good mountaineers accept
without demur, explaining that mountaineers
were the first to write fitly of the mountains,
that English mountaineers had a peculiar
talent in this direction, and that all the best
mountain literature was written in the last
half of the nineteenth century. These pious
conclusions were shattered by some very
radical criticism which appeared in leading
articles of <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Field</i>. The
former paper, in the course of some criticisms
of Mr. Spender’s Alpine Anthology, remarked:
“In the matter of prose, on the other hand,
he has a striking predilection for the modern
‘Alpine books’ of commerce, though hardly
a book among them except Whymper’s
<i>Scrambles in the Alps</i> has any real literary
vitality, or any interest apart from the story
of adventure which it tells. Mummery, perhaps,
has individuality enough to be made
welcome in any gallery, and, of course, one
is glad to meet Leslie Stephen. But what is
C. E. Mathews doing there? Or Norman
Neruda? Or Mr. Frederic Harrison? In an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
anthology which professed to be nothing more
than a collection of stories of adventure,
accidents, and narrow escapes, they would
have their place along with Owen Glynne
Jones, and Mr. Douglas Freshfield, and
innumerable contributors to <i>Peaks, Passes,
and Glaciers</i> and <i>The Alpine Journal</i>.”</p>

<p>We rubbed our eyes when we read these
heterodox sentiments in such a quarter.
Mr. Mathews was, perhaps, an Alpine historian
rather than a writer of descriptive prose, and
he does not lend himself to the elegant extract,
though he is the author of some very quotable
Alpine sketches. To Mr. Freshfield we owe,
amongst other good things, one short passage
as dramatic as anything in Alpine literature,
the passage in which he describes the discovery
of Donkin’s last bivouac on Koshtantau.
<i>The Field</i> was even more emphatic:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“What is not true is that the pioneer sportsmen
who founded the Alpine Club had
exceptional insight into the moods of the
snow. One or two of them, no doubt, struck
out a little literature as the result of the
impact of novel experiences upon naïve
minds.... On the whole, in spite of their
defects, their machine-made perorations and
their ponderous jests, they brought an acceptable
addition to the existing stock of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
literature of adventure.... But they had
their limitations, and these were rather
narrow. They dealt almost exclusively with
the externals of mountaineering experience;
and when they ventured further their writing
was apt to be of the quality of fustian. Their
spiritual adventures among the mountains
were apt to be melodramatic or insignificant.
Perhaps their Anglo-Saxon reticence prevented
themselves from ‘letting themselves go.’...
At all events there does remain this notable
distinction&mdash;that, while the most eloquent
writings of the most eloquent Alpine Club-man
are as a rule deliberately and ostentatiously
objective, the subjective literature of
mountains&mdash;the literature in which we see
the writer yielding to the influence of scenery,
instead of lecturing about its beauties, existed
long before that famous dinner party at the
house of William Mathews, senior, at which
the Alpine Club was founded. England, as
we have said, contributed practically nothing
to that literature.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We have quoted this passage at some length
because it expresses a novel attitude in direct
contradiction to the accepted views sanctified
by tradition. We do not entirely endorse it.
The article contains proof that its writer has
an intimate knowledge of early Alpine literature,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
but one is tempted to fancy that his
research did not survive the heavy period
of the ’eighties, and that he is unacquainted
with those modern writers whose work is
distinctly subjective. None the less, his contention
suggests an interesting line of study;
and in this chapter we shall try briefly to
sketch the main tendencies, though we cannot
review in detail the whole history, of Alpine
literature, a subject which requires a book
in itself.</p>

<p>The mediæval attitude towards mountains
has already been discussed, and though we
ventured to protest that love of the mountains
was not quite so uncommon as is usually supposed,
it must be freely admitted that the
literature of the Middle Ages is comparatively
barren in appreciation of mountain scenery.
There were Protestants before Luther, and
there were men such as Gesner and Petrarch
before Rousseau; but the Middle Ages can
scarcely rob Rousseau of the credit for transforming
mountain worship from the cult of a
minority into a comparatively fashionable
creed. Rousseau’s own feeling for the mountains
was none the less genuine because it
was sometimes coloured by the desire to make
the mountains echo his own philosophy of life.
Rousseau, in this respect, set a fashion which
his disciples were not slow to follow. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
mountains as the home of the rugged Switzer
could be made to preach edifying lay sermons
on the value of liberty. Such sentiments were
in tune with the spirit of revolt that culminated
in the French Revolution. A certain Haller
had sounded this note long before Rousseau
began to write, in a poem on the Alps which,
appearing in 1728, enjoyed considerable popularity.
The author is not without a genuine
appreciation for Alpine scenery, but he is
far more occupied with his moral, the contrast
between the unsophisticated life of the mountain
peasant and the hyper-civilisation of the
town. Throughout the writings of this school
which Haller anticipated and Rousseau
founded, we can trace an obvious connection
between a love for the untutored freedom of
the mountains and a hatred of existing social
conditions.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not surprising to find that
this new school of mountain worship involved
certain views which found most complete
expression in the French Revolution. “Man
is born free, but is everywhere in chains.”
This, the famous opening to <i>The Social
Contract</i>, might have heralded with equal
fitness any mountain passage in the works
of Rousseau or his disciples. Perhaps these
two sentiments are nowhere fused with such
completeness as in the life of Ramond de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Carbonnière, the great Pyrenean climber.
We have not mentioned him before as he took
no part in purely Alpine explorations. But as
a mountaineer he ranks with De Saussure and
Paccard. His ascent of Mont Perdu, after
many attempts, in 1802, was one of the most
remarkable climbing exploits of the age. He
invented a new kind of crampon. He rejoiced
in fatigue, cold, and the thousand trials that
confronted the mountaineer in the days before
club-huts. His own personality was singularly
arresting; and the reader should consult <i>The
Early Mountaineers</i> for a more complete
sketch of the man than we have space to
attempt. Ramond had every instinct of the
modern mountaineer. He delighted in hardship.
He could appreciate the grandeur of a mountain
storm while sitting on an exposed ledge.
He lingers with a delight that recalls Gesner
on the joy of simple fare and rough quarters.
He is the boon companion of hunters and
smugglers; and through all his mountain
journeys his mind is alert in reacting to chance
impressions.</p>

<p>But his narrative is remarkable for something
else besides love for the mountains. It
is full of those sentiments which came to a
head in the French Revolution. Mountain
description and fierce denunciations of tyranny
are mingled in the oddest fashion. It is not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
surprising that Ramond, who finds room in a
book devoted to mountaineering for a prophecy
of the Revolution, should have played an
active part in the Revolution when it came.
Ramond entered the Revolutionary Parliament
as a moderate reformer, and when the
leaders of the Revolution had no further use
for moderate reformers he found himself in
the gaol at Tarbres. Here he was fortunately
forgotten, and survived to become Maître des
Requêtes under Louis XVIII. Ramond is,
perhaps, the most striking example of the
mountaineer whose love for mountains was
only equalled by his passion for freedom. In
some ways, he is worthier of our admiration
than Rousseau, for he not only admired
mountains, he climbed them. He not only
praised the simple life of hardship, he endured it.</p>

<p>Turning to English literature, we find much
the same processes at work. The two great
poets whose revolt against existing society
was most marked yielded the Alps a generous
measure of praise. It is interesting to compare
the mountain songs of Byron and Shelley.
Byron’s verse is often marred by his obvious
sense of the theatre. His misanthropy had,
no doubt, its genuine as well as its purely
theatrical element, but it becomes tiresome
as the <i>motif</i> of the mountain message. No
doubt he was sincere when he wrote&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I live not in myself, but I become<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Portion of that around me, and to me<br /></span>
<span class="i1">High mountains are a feeling, but the sum<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of human cities torture.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But as a matter of actual practice no man
lived more in himself, and instead of becoming
a portion of his surroundings, too often he
makes his surroundings take colouring from
his mood. His mountains sometimes seem
to have degenerated into an echo of Byron.
They are too anxious to advertise the whole
gospel of misanthropy. The avalanche roars
a little too lustily. The Alpine glow is laid
on with a heavy brush, and his mountains
cannot wholly escape the suspicion of bluster
that tends to degenerate into bombast. This
is undeniable, yet Byron at his best is difficult
to approach. Freed from his affectations, his
verse often rises to the highest levels of simple,
unaffected eloquence. There are lines in <i>The
Prisoner of Chillon</i> with an authentic appeal
to the mountain lover. The prisoner has been
freed from the chain that has bound him for
years to a pillar, and he is graciously allowed
the freedom of his dungeon&mdash;a concession that
may not have appeared unduly liberal to his
gaolers, but which at least enabled the
prisoner to reach a window looking out on
to the hills&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I made a footing in the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It was not therefrom to escape.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But I was curious to ascend<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To my barr’d windows, and to bend<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Once more upon the mountain high<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The quiet of a loving eye.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">I saw them and they were the same<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They were not changed like me in frame;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I saw their thousand years of snow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On high&mdash;their wide long lake below.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the blue Rhone in fullest flow; ...<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I saw the white walled distant town;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And whiter sails go skimming down;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And then there was a little isle<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Which in my very face did smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i7">The only one in view.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the train swings round the elbow above
the lake, the mountaineer released from the
chain of city life can echo this wish to bend
the quiet of a loving eye on unchanging
mountains.</p>

<p>Coleridge has some good lines on Mont
Blanc, but one feels that they would have
applied equally well to any other mountain.
Their sincerity is somewhat discounted by
the fact that Coleridge manufactured an
enthusiasm for Mont Blanc at a distance
from which it is invisible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<p>With Shelley, we move in a different atmosphere.
Like Byron, he rebelled against
society, and some comfortable admirers of
the poetry which time has made respectable
are apt to ignore those poems which, for
passionate protest against social conditions,
remained unique till William Morris transformed
Socialism into song. Shelley was
more sincere in his revolt than Byron. He
did not always keep an eye on the gallery
while declaiming his rebellion, and his mountains
have no politics; they sing their own
spontaneous melodies. Shelley combined the
mystic’s vision with the accuracy of a trained
observer. His descriptions of an Alpine
dawn, or a storm among the mountains,
might have been written by a man who had
studied these phenomena with a note-book
in his hand. Nobody has ever observed with
such sympathy “the dim enchanted shapes
of wandering mist,” or brought more beauty
to their praise. Shelley’s cloud poems have
the same fugitive magic that haunts the
fickle countries of the sky when June is stirring
in those windy hills where&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“Dense fleecy clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are wandering in thick flocks among the mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shepherded by the slow unwilling wind.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>Shelley did not start with the poem, but with
the mountain. His mountains are something
more than a convenient instrument for the
manufacture of rhyme. He did not write a
poem about mountains as a pleasant variation
on more conventional themes. With Shelley,
you know that poetry was the handmaid of
the hills, the one medium in which he could
fitly express his own passionate worship of
every accent in the mountain melody. And
for these reasons Shelley seems to us a truer
mountain poet than Byron, truer than Coleridge,
truer even than Wordsworth, for Wordsworth,
though some of his Alpine poetry is
very good indeed, seems more at home in the
Cumberland fells, whose quiet music no other
poet has ever rendered so surely.</p>

<p>The early literature of the mountains has
an atmosphere which has largely disappeared
in modern Alpine writing. For, to the pioneers
of Alpine travel, a mountain was not primarily
a thing to climb. Even men like Bourrit
and Ramond de Carbonnière, genuine mountaineers
in every sense of the term, regarded
the great heights as something more than
fields for exploration, as the shrines of an
unseen power that compelled spontaneous
worship. These men saw a mountain, and
not a problem in gymnastics. They wrote
of mountains with a certain naïve eloquence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
often highly coloured, sometimes a trifle
bombastic. But, because the best of them
had French blood in their veins, their outpourings
were at least free from Saxon self-consciousness.
They were not writing for an
academic audience lenient to dullness, but
convulsed with agonies of shame at any
suspicion of fine writing. One shudders to
think of Bourrit delivering his sonorous
address on the guides of Chamounix as the
high priests of humanity before the average
audience that assembles to hear an Alpine
paper. We have seen two old gentlemen
incapacitated for the evening by a paper
pitched on a far more subdued note. Yet,
somehow, the older writings have the genuine
ring. They have something lacking in the
genial rhapsodies of their successors. “We
can never over-estimate what we owe to the
Alps”: thus opens a characteristic peroration
to an Alpine book of the ’eighties. “We are
indebted to them and all their charming
associations for the greatest of all blessings,
friendship and health. It has been conclusively
proved that, of all sports, it is the
one which can be protracted to the greatest
age. It is in the mountains that our youth is
renewed. Young, middle-aged, or old, we go
out, too often jaded and worn in mind and
body; and we return invigorated, renewed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
restored, fitted for the fresh labours and duties
of life. To know the great mountains wholly
is impossible for any of us; but reverently to
learn the lessons they can teach, and heartily
to enjoy the happiness they can bring is possible
to us all.”</p>

<p>If a man who has climbed for thirty years
cannot pump up something more lively as
his final summary of Alpine joys, what reply
can we make to Ruskin’s contention that “the
real beauties of the Alps are to be seen and to
be seen only where all may see it, the cripple,
the child, and the man of grey hairs”?
There are a few Alpine writers who have produced
an apology worthy of the craft, and
have shown that they had found above the
snow-line an outlet for romance unknown to
Ruskin’s cripple, and reserves of beauty which
Ruskin himself had never drawn, and there are,
on the other hand, quite enough to explain,
if not to justify, the unlovely conception of
Alpine climbers embodied in Ruskin’s amiable
remarks: “The Alps themselves, which your
own poets used to love so reverently, you look
upon as soaped poles in a beer garden which
you set yourselves to climb and slide down
again with shrieks of delight. When you are
past shrieking, having no articulate voice to
say you are glad with, you rush home red
with cutaneous eruptions of conceit, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
voluble with convulsive hiccoughs of self-satisfaction.”</p>

<p>With a few great exceptions, the literature
of mountaineers is not as fine as the literature
of mountain lovers. Let us see what the men
who have not climbed have given to the
praise of the snows. What mountaineer has
written as Ruskin wrote? Certainly Ruskin
at his best reaches heights which no mountaineer
has ever scaled. When Ruskin read
his Inaugural Address in the early ’fifties
to an audience in the main composed of
Cambridge undergraduates, he paused for a
moment and glanced up at his audience.
When he saw that the fleeting attention of
the undergraduates had been arrested by this
sudden pause, he declaimed a passage which
he did not intend any of them to miss, a
passage describing the Alps from the southern
plains: “Out from between the cloudy pillars
as they pass, emerge for ever the great battlements
of the memorable and perpetual
hills.”... When he paused again, after
the sonorous fall of a majestic peroration,
even the most prosaic of undergraduates
joined in the turbulent applause.</p>

<p>“Language which to a severe taste is perhaps
a trifle too fine,” is Leslie Stephen’s
characteristic comment. “It is not every
one,” he adds, with trenchant common sense,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
“who can with impunity compare Alps to
archangels.” Perhaps not, and let us therefore
be thankful to the occasional writer, who,
like Ruskin and Leslie Stephen himself at his
best, is not shamed into dullness by the fear
of soaring too high. But Ruskin was something
more than a fine writer. No man, and
no mountaineer, ever loved the Alps with a
more absorbing passion; and, in the whole
realm of Alpine literature, there is no passage
more pregnant with the unreasoning love for
the hills than that which opens: “For to
myself mountains are the beginning and the
end of all Alpine scenery,” and ends: “There
is not a wave of the Seine but is associated in
my mind with the first rise of the sandstones
and forest pines of Fontainebleau; and with
the hope of the Alps, as one leaves Paris with
the horses’ heads to the south-west, the
morning sun flashing on the bright waves at
Charenton. If there be no hope or association
of this kind, and if I cannot deceive myself
into fancying that, perhaps at the next rise
of the road, there may be seen the film of a
blue hill in the gleam of sky at the horizon,
the landscape, however beautiful, produces in
me even a kind of sickness and pain; and the
whole view from Richmond Hill or Windsor
Terrace&mdash;nay, the gardens of Alcinous, with
their perpetual summer&mdash;or of the Hesperides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
(if they were flat, and not close to Atlas),
golden apples and all&mdash;I would give away in
an instant, for one mossy granite stone a foot
broad, and two leaves of lady-fern.”</p>

<p>George Meredith was no mountaineer; but
his mountain passages will not easily be beaten.
His description of the Alps seen from the
Adriatic contains, perhaps, the subtlest phrase
in literature for the colouring of distant
ranges: “Colour was steadfast on the massive
front ranks; it wavered in its remoteness and
was quick and dim <i>as though it fell on beating
wings</i>.” And no climber has analysed the
climber’s conflicting emotions with such
sympathetic acuteness. “Would you know
what it is to hope again, and have all your
hopes at hand? Hang upon the crags at a
gradient that makes your next step a debate
between the thing you are and the thing you
may become. There the merry little hopes
grow for the climber like flowers and food,
immediate, prompt to prove their uses,
sufficient if just within grasp, as mortal hopes
should be.”</p>

<p>We have quoted Ruskin’s great tribute to
the romance which still haunts the journey
to the Alps even for those who are brought
up on steam. Addington Symonds was no
mountaineer; but he writes of this journey
with an enthusiasm which rings truer than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
much in Alpine adventure: “Of all the joys
in life, none is greater than the joy of arriving
on the outskirts of Switzerland at the end of a
long dusty day’s journey from Paris. The
true epicure in refined pleasures will never
travel to Basle by night. He courts the heat
of the sun and the monotony of French
plains&mdash;their sluggish streams, and never-ending
poplar trees&mdash;for the sake of the
evening coolness and the gradual approach
to the great Alps, which await him at the
close of the day. It is about Mulhausen that
he begins to feel a change in the landscape.
The fields broaden into rolling downs, watered
by clear and running streams; the great Swiss
thistle grows by riverside and cowshed; pines
begin to tuft the slopes of gently rising hills;
and now the sun has set, the stars come out,
first Hesper, then the troop of lesser lights;
and he feels&mdash;yes, indeed, there is now no
mistake&mdash;the well-known, well-loved, magical
fresh air, that never fails to blow from snowy
mountains, and meadows watered by perennial
streams. The last hour is one of exquisite
enjoyment, and when he reaches Basle he
scarcely sleeps all night for hearing the swift
Rhine beneath the balconies, and knowing
that the moon is shining on its waters, through
the town, beneath the bridges, between
pasture-lands and copses, up the still mountain-girdled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
valleys to the ice-caves where the
water springs. There is nothing in all experience
of travelling like this. We may
greet the Mediterranean at Marseilles with
enthusiasm; on entering Rome by the Porta
del Popolo we may reflect with pride that
we have reached the goal of our pilgrimage,
and are at last among world-shaking memories.
But neither Rome nor the Riviera wins our
hearts like Switzerland. We do not lie awake
in London thinking of them; we do not long
so intensely, as the year comes round, to
revisit them. Our affection is less a passion
than that which we cherish for Switzerland.”</p>

<p>Among modern writers there is Mr. Belloc,
who stands self-confessed as a man who
refuses to climb for fear of “slipping down.”
Mr. Belloc has French blood in his veins, and
he is not cursed with British reserve. In his
memorable journey along the path to Rome,
he had, perforce, to cross the Jura, and this
is how he first saw the Alps&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I saw, between the branches of the trees
in front of me, a sight in the sky that made
me stop breathing, just as a great danger at
sea, or great surprise in love, or a great
deliverance will make a man stop breathing.
I saw something I had known in the West as
a boy, something I had never seen so grandly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
discovered as was this. In between the
branches of the trees was a great promise
of unexpected lights beyond....</p>

<p>“Here were these magnificent creatures of
God, I mean the Alps, which now for the first
time I saw from the height of the Jura; and,
because they were fifty or sixty miles away,
and because they were a mile or two high,
they were become something different from
us others, and could strike one motionless
with the awe of supernatural things. Up
there in the sky, to which only clouds belong,
and birds, and the last trembling colours of
pure light, they stood fast and hard; not
moving as do the things of the sky....</p>

<p>“These, the great Alps, seen thus, link one
in some way to one’s immortality. Nor is it
possible to convey, or even to suggest, those
few fifty miles, and those few thousand feet;
there is something more. Let me put it thus:
that from the height of Weissenstein I saw, as
it were, my religion. I mean humility, the
fear of death, the terror of height and of distance,
the glory of God, the infinite potentiality
of reception whence springs that divine
thirst of the soul; my aspiration also towards
completion, and my confidence in the dual
destiny. For I know that we laughers have
a gross cousinship with the most high, and
it is this contrast and perpetual quarrel which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
feeds a spring of merriment in the soul of a
sane man.... That it is also which leads
some men to climb mountain tops, but not
me, for I am afraid of slipping down.”</p></blockquote>

<p>That is subjective enough, with a vengeance;
for those few lines one would gladly sacrifice
a whole shelf full of climbing literature dealing
with the objective facts that do not vary
with the individual observer.</p>

<p>Mr. Kipling again, though no mountaineer,
has struck out one message which most
mountaineers would sacrifice a season’s climbing
to have written. A brief quotation gives
only a faint impression of its beauty&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At last, they entered a world within a
world&mdash;a valley of leagues where the high
hills were fashioned of the mere rubble and
refuse from off the knees of the mountains.
Here, one day’s march carried them no farther,
it seemed, than a dreamer’s clogged pace
bears him in a nightmare. They skirted a
shoulder painfully for hours, and behold, it
was but an outlying boss in an outlying
buttress of the main pile! A rounded meadow
revealed itself, when they had reached it,
for a vast table-land running far into the
valley. Three days later, it was a dim fold
in the earth to southward.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>“‘Surely the Gods live here,’ said Kim,
beaten down by the silence and the appalling
sweep and dispersal of the cloud-shadows
after rain. ‘This is no place for men!’</p>

<p>“Above them, still enormously above them,
earth towered away towards the snow-line,
where from east to west across hundreds of
miles, ruled as with a ruler, the last of the
bold birches stopped. Above that, in scarps
and blocks upheaved, the rocks strove to
fight their heads above the white smother.
Above these again, changeless since the
world’s beginning, but changing to every
mood of sun and cloud, lay out the eternal
snow. They could see blots and blurs on
its face where storm and wandering wullie-wa
got up to dance. Below them, as they stood,
the forest slid away in a sheet of blue-green
for mile upon mile; below the forest was a
village in its sprinkle of terraced fields and
steep grazing-grounds; below the village they
knew, though a thunderstorm worried and
growled there for the moment, a pitch of
twelve or fifteen hundred feet gave to the
moist valley where the streams gather that
are the mothers of young Sutluj.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Then there is Mr. Algernon Blackwood, who
is, I think, rather a ski-runner than a mountaineer.
Certainly he has unravelled the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
psychology of hill-wandering, and discovered
something of that strange personality behind
the mountains. No writer has so successfully
caught the uncanny atmosphere that sometimes
haunts the hills.</p>

<p>The contrast is even more marked in poetry
than in prose. In prose, we have half-a-dozen
Alpine books that would satisfy a severe
critic. In poetry, only one mountaineer has
achieved outstanding success. Mr. G. Winthrop
Young, alone, has transferred the
essential romance of mountaineering into
poetry which not mountaineers alone, but
every lover of finished craftsmanship, will
read with something deeper than pleasure.
But, while Mr. Young has no rival in the
poetry of mountaineering, there is a considerable
quantity of excellent verse of which
mountains are the theme. We have spoken
of Shelley and Byron. Among more modern
poets there is Tennyson. He wrote little
mountain poetry, and yet in four lines he has
crystallised the whole essence of the Alpine
vision from some distant sentinel of the
plains&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“How faintly flushed, how phantom fair<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was Monte Rosa, hanging there<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A thousand shadowy pencilled valleys<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And snowy dells in a golden air.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>Sydney Dobell has some good mountain
verse; and if we had not already burdened
this chapter with quotations we should have
borrowed from those descriptions in which
Morris clearly recalls the savage volcanic
scenery of Iceland. Swinburne, in the lines
beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">“Me the snows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That face the first of the morning”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>has touched some of the less obvious spells
of hill region with his own unerring instinct
for beauty.</p>

<p>F. W. H. Myers in eight lines has said all
that need be said when the hills have claimed
the ultimate penalty&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here let us leave him: for his shroud the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For funeral lamps he has the planets seven,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a great sign the icy stair shall go<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Between the stars to heaven.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">One moment stood he as the angels stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">High in the stainless eminence of air.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The next he was not, to his fatherland<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Translated unaware.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Holland has written, as a dedication
for a book of Alpine travel, lines which have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the authentic note; and Mr. Masefield in a
few verses has caught the savage aloofness
of the peaks better than most mountaineers
in pages of redundant description.</p>

<p>The contrast is rather too marked between
the work of those who loved mountains without
climbing them and the literature of the
professional mountaineers. Even writers like
Mr. Kipling, who have only touched mountains
in a few casual lines, seem to have captured
the mountain atmosphere more successfully
than many a climber who has devoted articles
galore to his craft. Of course, Mr. Kipling
is a genius and the average Alpine writer is
not; but surely one might not unreasonably
expect a unique literature from those who
know the mountains in all their changing
tenses, and who by service of toil and danger
have wrung from them intimate secrets
unguessed at by those who linger outside the
shrine.</p>

<p>Mountaineering has, of course, produced
some great literature. There is Leslie
Stephen, though even Stephen at his best is
immeasurably below Ruskin’s finest mountain
passages. But Leslie Stephens are rare in
the history of Alpine literature, whereas the
inarticulate are always with us.</p>

<p>In some ways, the man who can worship
a mountain without wishing to climb it has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
a certain advantage. He sees a vision, where
the climber too often sees nothing but a
variation route. The popular historian has
often a more vivid picture of a period than
the expert, whose comprehensive knowledge
of obscure charters sometimes blinds him
to the broad issues of history. Technical
knowledge does not always make for understanding.
The first great revelation of the
mountains has a power that is all its own. To
the man who has yet to climb, every mountain
is virgin, every snow-field a mystery, undefiled
by traffic with man. The first vision passes,
and the love that is based on understanding
supplants it. The vision of unattainable
snows translates itself into terms of memory&mdash;that
white gleam that once belonged to
dreamland into an ice-wall with which you
have wrestled through the scorching hours
of a July afternoon. You have learned to
spell the writing on the wall of the mountains.
The magic of first love, with its worship of the
unattainable, is too often transformed into
the soberer affection founded, like domestic
love, on knowledge and sympathy; and the
danger would be greater if the fickle hills had
not to be wooed afresh every season. Beyond
the mountain that we climb and seem to know,
lurks ever the visionary peak that we shall
never conquer; and this unattainable ideal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
gives an eternal youth to the hills, and a never-failing
vitality to our Alpine adventure. Yet
when we begin to set down our memories of
the mountains, it seems far easier to recall
those objective facts, which are the same for
all comers, the meticulous details of route,
the conditions of snow and ice, and to omit
from our epic that subjective vision of the
mountain, that individual impression which
alone lends something more than a technical
interest to the story of our days among the
snow. And so it is not altogether surprising
that the man who has never climbed can
write more freely and more fully of the
mountains, since he has no expert knowledge
to confuse the issue, no technical details to
obscure the first fine careless rapture.</p>

<p>The early mountaineers entered into a
literary field that was almost unexplored.
They could write of their hill journeys with
the assurance of men branching out into
unknown byways. They could linger on
the commonplaces of hill travel, and praise
the freedom of the hills with the air of men
enunciating a paradox. To glorify rough fare,
simple quarters, a bed of hay, a drink quaffed
from the mountain stream, must have
afforded Gesner the same intellectual pleasure
that Mr. Chesterton derives from the praise of
Battersea and Beer. And this joy in emotions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
which had yet to be considered trite lingers
on even into the more sedate pages of <i>Peaks,
Passes, and Glaciers</i>. The contributors to
those classic volumes were rather frightened
of letting themselves go; but here and there
one lights on some spontaneous expression of
delight in the things that are the very flesh
and blood of our Alpine experience&mdash;the
bivouac beneath the stars, the silent approach
of dawn, the freemasonry of the rope, the
triumph of the virgin summit. “Times have
changed since then,” wrote Donald Robertson
in a recent issue of <i>The Alpine Journal</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Times have changed since then, and with
them Alpine literature. Mountaineering has
become a science, and, as in other sciences, the
professor has grown impatient of the average
intelligence, and evolved his own tongue.
To write for the outside public is to incur the
odium of ‘popular science,’ a form of literature
fascinating to me, but anathema to all right-minded
men. Those best qualified to speak
will only address themselves to those qualified
to listen, and therefore only in the jargon of
their craft. But the hall-mark of technical
writing is the assumption of common knowledge.
What all readers know for themselves,
it is needless and even impertinent to state.
Hence, in the climbing stories written for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
elect, the features common to all climbs must
either be dismissed with a brief reference, or
lightly treated as things only interesting in
so far as they find novel expression.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Those who worship Clio the muse will try
to preserve the marriage of history and
literature, but those whose only claim to
scholarship is their power to collate facts by
diligent research, those who have not the
necessary ability to weave these facts into a
vital pattern, will always protest their devotion
to what is humorously dubbed scientific
history. So in the Alpine world, which has
its own academic traditions and its own
mandarins, you will find that those who
cannot translate emotions (which it is to be
hoped they share) into language which anybody
could understand are rather apt to
explain their discreet silence, by the possession
of a delicate reserve that forbids them to
emulate the fine writing of a Ruskin or the
purple patches of Meredith.</p>

<p>Now, it should be possible to discriminate
between those who endeavour to clothe a fine
emotion in worthy language, and those who
start with the intention of writing finely, and
look round for a fine emotion to serve as the
necessary peg. Sincerity is the touchstone
that discriminates the fine writing that is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
good, and the fine writing that is damnable.
The emotions that are the essence of mountaineering
deserve something better than the
genteel peroration of the average climbing
book. Alpine literature is a trifle deficient
in fine frenzy. The Mid-Victorian pose of the
bluff, downright Briton, whose surging flood
of emotions is concealed beneath an affectation
of cynicism, is apt to be tedious, and one
wonders whether emotions so consistently
and so successfully suppressed really existed
within those stolid bosoms.</p>

<p>A great deal of Alpine literature appeals,
and rightly appeals, only to the expert. Such
contributions are not intended as descriptive
literature. They may, as the record of
research into the early records of mountaineering
and mountains, supply a much-needed
link in the history of the craft. As the record
of new exploration, they are sure to interest
the expert, while their exact description of
routes and times will serve as the material for
future climbers’ guides. But this is not the
whole of Alpine literature, and the danger is
that those who dare not attempt the subjective
aspects of mountaineering should
frighten off those who have the necessary
ability by a tedious repetition of the phrase
“fine writing,” that facile refuge of the
Philistine. The conventional Alpine article
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
is a dreary affair. Its humour is antique, and
consists for the most part in jokes about fleas
and porters, and in the substitution of long
phrases for simple ones. Its satire is even
thinner. The root assumption that the Alpine
climber is a superior person, and that social
status varies with the height above sea level,
recurs with monotonous regularity. The joke
about the tripper is as old as the Flood, and
the instinct that resents his disturbing presence
is not quite the hall-mark of the æsthetic soul
that some folk seem to think. It is as old as
the primitive man who espied a desirable glade,
and lay in wait for the first tourist with a
club. “My friends tell me,” writes a well-known
veteran, “that I am singular in this
strange desire to avoid meeting the never-ceasing
stream of tourists, and I am beginning
to believe that they are right, and that I am
differently constituted from other people.”
The author of this trite confession has only
to study travel literature in general and Alpine
literature in particular to discover that quite
commonplace folk can misquote the remark
about the madding crowd, and that even
members of the lower middle class have been
known to put the sentiment into practice.
A sense of humour and a sense for solitude
are two things which their true possessors are
chary of mentioning.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>It might be fairly argued that the average
mountaineer does not pretend to be a writer,
fine or otherwise, that he describes his climbs
in a club journal intended for a friendly and
uncritical audience, and that he leaves the
defence of his sport to the few men who can
obtain the hearing of a wider audience. That
is fair comment; and, fortunately, mountaineering
is not without the books that are
classics not only of Alpine but also of English
literature.</p>

<p>First to claim mention is <i>Peaks, Passes,
and Glaciers</i>, a volume “so fascinating,” writes
Donald Robertson, “so inspiring a gospel of
adventure and full, free life, that the call
summoned to the hills an army of seekers
after the promised gold.” That is true
enough. But the charm of these pages, which
is undoubted, is much more due to the fact
that the contributors had a good story to tell
than to any grace of style with which they
told it. The contributors were drawn from
all walks of life&mdash;barristers, Manchester merchants,
schoolmasters, dons, clergymen, and
scientists; and unless we must affect to believe
that Alpine climbing inspires its devotees
with the gift of tongues, we need not appear
guilty of irreverence for the pioneers if we
discriminate between the literary and intrinsic
merit of their work. They were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
educated men. They did not split their
infinitives, and they could express their
thoughts in the King’s English, a precedent
not always followed by their successors. We
must, however, differentiate between the
Alpine writing which gives pleasure because
of its associations, and the literature which
delights not only for its associations and story,
but also for its beauty of expression. Let us,
as an example, consider two passages describing
an Alpine dawn&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We set out from the bivouac at three in
the morning. The night was cloudless, and
the stars shone with a truly majestic beauty.
Ahead of us, we could just see the outline of
the great peak we proposed to attack. Gradually,
the east lightened. The mountains became
more distinct. The eastern sky paled,
and a few minutes later the glorious sun
caught the topmost peaks, and painted their
snows with the fiery hues of dawn. It was a
most awe-compelling spectacle.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This passage may please us, not because
the language is fine or the thoughts subtly
expressed, but simply because the scenes so
inadequately described recall those which
we ourselves have witnessed. The passage
would convey little to a man who had never
climbed. Now consider the following&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On the glacier, the light of a day still to
be born put out our candles.... We halted
to watch the procession of the sun. He came
out of the uttermost parts of the earth, very
slowly, lighting peak after peak in the long
southward array, dwelling for a moment, and
then passing on. Opposite, and first to catch
the glow, were the great mountains of the
Saasgrat and the Weisshorn. <i>But more
beautiful, like the loom of some white-sailed
ship far out at sea, each unnamed and unnumbered
peak of the east took and reflected the
radiance of the morning.</i> The light mists
which came before the sun faded.”...</p></blockquote>

<p>Like the other passage this brief description
starts a train of memories; but, whereas the
first passage would convey little to a non-climber,
Sir Claud Schuster has really thought
out the sequence of the dawn, and has caught
one of its finer and subtler effects by the use
of a very happy analogy. The phrase which
we have ventured to italicise defines in a few
words a brief scene in the drama of the dawn,
an impression that could not be conveyed by
piling adjective on adjective.</p>

<p>There are many writers who have captured
the romance of mountaineering, far fewer who
have the gift for that happy choice of words
that gives the essence of a particular Alpine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
view. Pick up any Alpine classic at a venture,
and you will find that not one writer in fifty
can hold your attention through a long passage
of descriptive writing. The average writer
piles on his adjectives. From the Alpine
summit you can see a long way. The horizon
seems infinitely far off. The valleys sink
below into profound shadows. The eye is
carried from the dark firs upward to the
glittering snowfields. “The majestic mass of
the ... rises to the north, and blots out the
lesser ranges of the.... The awful heights
of the ... soar upwards from the valley
of.... In the east, we could just catch a
glimpse of the ... and our guides assured
us that in the west we could veritably see the
distant snows of our old friend the....” And
so on, and so forth. Fill in the gaps, and this
skeleton description can be made to fit the
required panorama. It roughly represents
nine out of ten word pictures of Alpine views.
Examine Whymper’s famous description of
the view from the Matterhorn. It is little
more than a catalogue of mountains. There
is hardly a phrase in it that would convey the
essential atmosphere of such a view to a man
who had not seen it.</p>

<p>Genius has been defined as the power of
seeing analogies, and we have sometimes
fancied that the secret of all good Alpine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
description lies in the happy choice of the
right analogy. It is no use accumulating the
adjective at random. Peaks are high and
majestic, the snow is white. Certainly this
does not help us. What we need is some
happily chosen phrase which goes deeper than
the obvious epithets that apply to every
peak and every snowfield. We want the
magical phrase that differentiates one particular
Alpine setting from another. And this
phrase will often be some apparently casual
analogy drawn from something which has no
apparent connection with the Alps. “Beautiful
like the loom of some white-sailed ship,”
is an example which we have already quoted.
Leslie Stephen’s work is full of such analogies.
He does not waste adjectives. His adjectives
are chosen for a particular reason. His
epithets all do work. Read his description
of the view from Mont Blanc, the Peaks of
Primiero, the Alps in winter, and you feel
that these descriptions could not be made to
apply to other Alpine settings by altering the
names and suppressing an occasional phrase.
They are charged with the individual atmosphere
of the place which gave them birth.
In the most accurate sense of the word, they
are autocthonous. A short quotation will
illustrate these facts. Here is Stephen’s
description of the view from the Schreckhorn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
Notice that he achieves his effect without the
usual largess of jewellery. Topaz and opal
are dispensed with, and their place is taken
by casual and apparently careless analogies
from such diversified things as an opium
dream, music, an idle giant.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“You are in the centre of a whole district
of desolation, suggesting a landscape from
Greenland, or an imaginary picture of England
in the glacial epoch, with shores yet unvisited
by the irrepressible Gulf Stream. The charm
of such views&mdash;little as they are generally
appreciated by professed admirers of the
picturesque&mdash;is to my taste unique, though
not easily explained to unbelievers. They
have a certain soothing influence like slow
and stately music, or one of the strange opium
dreams described by De Quincey. If his
journey in the mail-coach could have led him
through an Alpine pass instead of the quiet
Cumberland hills, he would have seen visions
still more poetical than that of the minister
in the ‘dream fugue.’ Unable as I am to bend
his bow, I can only say that there is something
almost unearthly in the sight of enormous
spaces of hill and plain, apparently unsubstantial
as a mountain mist, glimmering
away to the indistinct horizon, and as it were
spell-bound by an absolute and eternal silence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
The sentiment may be very different when a
storm is raging and nothing is visible but the
black ribs of the mountains glaring at you
through rents in the clouds; but on that
perfect day on the top of the Schreckhorn,
where not a wreath of vapour was to be seen
under the Whole vast canopy of the sky, a
delicious lazy sense of calm repose was the
appropriate frame of mind. One felt as if
some immortal being, with no particular
duties upon his hands, might be calmly
sitting upon those desolate rocks and watching
the little shadowy wrinkles of the plain, that
were really mountain ranges, rise and fall
through slow geological epochs.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Whymper never touches this note even in
the best of many good mountain passages.
His forte was rather the romance of Alpine
adventure than the subtler art of reproducing
Alpine scenery. But in his own line he is
without a master. His style, of course, was
not so uniformly good as Stephen’s. He had
terrible lapses. He spoils his greatest chapter
by a most uncalled-for anti-climax. He had
a weakness for banal quotations from third-rate
translations of the classics. But, though
these lapses are irritating, there is no book
like the famous <i>Scrambles</i>, and there is
certainly no book which has sent more new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
climbers to the Alps. Whymper was fortunate,
for he had as his material the finest
story in Alpine history. Certainly, he did not
waste his chances. The book has the genuine
ring of Alpine romance. Its pages are full of
those contrasts that are the stuff of our
mountain quest, the tragic irony that a Greek
mind would have appreciated. The closing
scenes in the great drama of the Matterhorn
move to their appointed climax with the
dignity of some of the most majestic chapters
in the Old Testament. Of their kind, they
are unique in the literature of exploration.</p>

<p>Tyndall, Whymper’s great rival, had literary
talent as well as scientific genius, but his
Alpine books, though they contain fine passages,
have not the personality that made
<i>Scrambles in the Alps</i> a classic, nor the genius
for descriptive writing that we admire in <i>The
Playground of Europe</i>. Of A. W. Moore’s
work and of Mummery’s great classic we have
already spoken. Mummery, like Whymper,
could translate into words the rollicking adventure
of mountaineering, and though he
never touches Leslie Stephen’s level, some of
his descriptions of mountain scenery have a
distinct fascination.</p>

<p>A few other great Alpine books have
appeared between <i>Peaks, Pastures, and
Glaciers</i> and the recent work <i>Peaks and</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
<i>Pleasant Pastures</i>. Mr. Douglas Freshfield
and Sir Martin Conway are both famous
explorers of the greater ranges beyond Europe,
and their talent for mountain description
must have inspired many a climber to leave
the well-trodden Alpine routes for the unknown
snows of the Himalayas. Mr. Freshfield’s
Caucasian classic opens with a short
poem that we should like to have quoted, and
includes one of the great stories on mountain
literature&mdash;the search for Donkin and Fox.
Sir Martin Conway brings to his work the
eye of a trained Art critic, and the gift for
analysing beauty, not only in pictures, but
in Alpine scenery. He is an artist in colour
and in words.</p>

<p>Contrary to accepted views, we are inclined
to believe that Alpine literature shows signs
of a Renaissance. Those who hold that the
subject-matter is exhausted, seem to base
their belief on the fact that every virgin peak
in the Alps has been climbed, and that the
literature of exploration should, therefore,
die a natural death. This belief argues a
lack of proportion. Because a certain number
of climbers have marched up and down the
peaks of a certain range, it does not follow
that those mountains no longer afford emotions
capable of literary expression. The very
reverse is the case. It is perilously easy to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
attach supreme importance to the sporting
side of our craft. Mountain literature is too
often tedious, because it concentrates on
objective facts. When all the great mountains
were unclimbed, those who wrote of them could
not burden their pages with tiresome details
of routes and times. When every mountain
has been climbed by every conceivable route,
the material at the disposal of the objective
writer is fortunately exhausted. There are
few great Alpine routes that remain unexplored.
There are a thousand byways in
the psychology of mountaineering that have
never been touched, and an excellent book
might have been written on this subject alone.
Every mountaineer brings to the mountains
the tribute of a new worshipper with his own
different emotions. “Obtain an account of
the same expedition from three points on the
same rope, and you will see how different.
Therefore, there is room in our generation for
a new <i>Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers</i> by the best
pens in the Club telling freely, and without
false shame, the simple story of a day among
the mountains.”</p>

<p>The pioneers had every advantage, a new
subject for literary expression, a new field of
almost untouched exploration, phrases that
had yet to become trite, emotions which
never become trite though their expression
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
is apt to fall into a rut. And yet it seems
doubtful whether they wrote more freely and
more truly than some of those who are writing
to-day. In some directions, mountain descriptions
have advanced as well as mountain
craft. We have no Leslie Stephen and no
Whymper, but the best pens at work in <i>The
Alpine Journal</i> have created a nobler literature
than that which we find in the early numbers.
“<i>The Alpine Journal</i>,” remarked a worthy
president, is “the champagne of Alpine
literature.” Like the best champagne, it is
often very dry. The early numbers contained
little of literary value beyond Gosset’s great
account of the avalanche which killed Bennen,
and some articles by Stephen and Whymper.
Neither Stephen nor Whymper wrote their
best for the club journal. <i>The Cornhill</i>
contains Stephen’s best work, and Whymper
gave the pick of his writing to the Press.
One may safely say that the first forty years
of the club journal produced nothing better
than recent contributions such as “The Alps”
by A. D. Godley, “Two Ridges of the Grand
Jorasses” by G. W. Young, “The Middle Age
of the Mountaineer” by Claud Schuster,
“Another Way of Alpine Love” by F. W.
Bourdillon, “The Ligurian Alps” by R. L. A.
Irving, and “Alpine Humour” by C. D.
Robertson. Nor has good work been confined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
to <i>The Alpine Journal</i>. The patient
seeker may find hidden treasures in the pages
of some score of journals devoted to some
aspect of the mountains. The new century
has opened well, for it has given us Prof.
Collie’s <i>Exploration in the Himalaya and other
Mountain Ranges</i>, a book of unusual charm.
It has given us Mr. Young’s mountain poems,
for which we would gladly jettison a whole
library of Alpine literature. It has given us
<i>Peaks and Pleasant Pastures</i>, and a fine
translation of Guido Rey’s classic work on the
Matterhorn. With these books in mind we
can safely assert that the writer quoted at the
beginning of this chapter was unduly pessimistic,
and that England has contributed her
fair share to the subjective literature of the
Alps.</p>

<p>Let us hope that this renaissance of wonder
will suffer no eclipse; let us hope that the
Alps may still offer to generations yet unborn
avenues of discovery beside those marked
“No Information” in the pages of <i>The
Climber’s Guides</i>. The saga of the Alps will
not die from lack of material so long as men
find in the hills an inspiration other than the
challenge of unclimbed ridges and byways of
mountain joy uncharted in the ordnance
survey.

<h2 id="BIBLIOGRAPHY">BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>The Alpine Club collects every book dealing with the
mountains and also most of the articles that appear in the
Press and Magazines. The Catalogue of the Alpine Club
Library should, therefore, be the most complete bibliography
in existence. The additions to the Club Library are published
from time to time in <i>The Alpine Journal</i>.</p>

<p>The most useful bibliographies of Alpine book that are
accessible to the general reader are contained in <i>Ueber Eis
and Schnee</i>, by Gottlieb Studer (1869-1871), and <i>Swiss Travel
and Swiss Guide Books</i>, by the Rev. W. A. B. Coolidge (1889).</p>

<p>Perhaps the most thorough book on every phase of the
Alps, sporting, social, political and historical is <i>The Alps in
Nature and History</i>, by the Rev. W. A. B. Coolidge (1908).</p>

<p>For the Geology of the Alps and the theory of Glacier
Motion there are no better books than <i>The Glaciers of the
Alps</i>, by John Tyndall (1860; reprinted in the Everyman
Library), and <i>The Building of the Alps</i>, by T. G. Bonney
(1912).</p>

<p>For the practical side of mountaineering, <i>Mountaineering</i>,
by C. T. Dent (Badminton Library), is good but somewhat
out of date.</p>

<p>The best modern book on the theory and practice of mountaineering
is <i>Modern Mountain Craft</i>, edited by G. W. Young
(1914). This book is in the Press. It contains chapters on
the theory of mountain craft in summer and winter, and in
addition a very able summary of the characteristic of mountaineering
in the great ranges beyond Europe as described
by the various experts for the particular districts.</p>

<p>Winter mountaineering and ski-ing are dealt with in <i>The</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
<i>Ski-Runner</i>, by E. C. Richardson (1909); <i>Ski-ing for Beginners
and Mountaineers</i>, by W. R. Rickmers (1910); <i>How to Ski</i>,
by Vivian Caulfield (1910); <i>Ski-ing</i>, by Arnold Lunn (1912).</p>

<p>For the general literature of mountaineering the reader
has a wide choice. We cannot attempt a comprehensive
bibliography, but the following books are the most interesting
of the many hundred volumes on the subject.</p>

<p>The early history of mountaineering is dealt with in Mr.
Coolidge’s books referred to above. There is a good historical
sketch in the first chapter of the Badminton volume. The
most readable book on the early pioneers is <i>The Early Mountaineers</i>,
by Francis Gribble (1899). <i>The Story of Alpine
Climbing</i>, by Francis Gribble (1904), is smaller than <i>The
Early Mountaineers</i>; it can be obtained for a shilling.</p>

<p>We shall, where possible, confine our list to books written
in English. This is not possible for the earlier works, as
English books do not cover the ground.</p>

<p>The reader will find good photographs very useful. The
earliest Alpine photographer to achieve distinct success was
Mr. Donkin, whose excellent photographs can be bought
cheaply. Signor Sellâs&mdash;the supreme artist in mountain
photography&mdash;also sells his work. Messrs. Abraham of
Keswick have photographed with thoroughness the Alps
and the rock climbs of Cumberland and Wales. Their best
work is reproduced in <i>The Complete Mountaineer</i>. (1908.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
